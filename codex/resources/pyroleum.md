# Pyroleum

An abiogenically originating hydrocarbon found in deposits in the crust of Pytheas—Pyroleum is _the_ oil. Theorized as the sister compound to Thaxene gas, it serves all machine applications. It can be processed to provide any viscosity range of hydrocarbon products including, but not limited to, greases, high temperature lubricants, and hydraulic oils. Due to the purity of Pyroleum, it is possible to achieve an almost unlimited number of derivatives with the proper chemistry, such as aldehydes, ketones, ethers, alkyl halides, alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides. The production of such varied by-products requires complex and detailed knowledge of chemistry and the appropriate equipment—one is available via the BASIN and the other at cost.&#x20;
