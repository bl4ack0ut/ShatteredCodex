# Nanites

An unexpected oddity has emerged from the high-powered electrical generation taking place on Pytheas. The spontaneous appearance of an inorganic, microscopic, nanobot machine—now commonly referred to as “Nanites”—has sparked an entire new set of research parameters and pathways. Guild scientist formal communications state that “These uniformly identical, minuscule, perovskite structures initially came into existence though a process of spontaneous coalescence around high voltage structures.” Once it was understood that the method of their formation mimicked that of a crystal lattice, the Guild scientists realized they could take a single Nanite and “seed” the high voltage lines of other structures, resulting in nucleation of subsequent Nanites. Without the seed Nanite, spontaneous nucleation _can_ occur but the resultant perovskite bot will generally have variations which can make the Nanite non-functional or less effective. It was discovered that the source of the material to form these tiny machines was gathered by the EMF (electromagnetic field) generated by the high voltage flowing through the power line—in essence the constant wind and dust storms continuously brought new material within range of the lines to lead to generation of new Nanites. Due to the exceptional magnetoresistance of these perovskite bots, once formed they are capable of being functionally “programmed” to accomplish difficult and repetitive tasks—most notably on the smallest scales. In addition, experiments are underway to outfit the base layer Nanites with microscopic appendages of various designs. Should these experiments succeed, the possible utilities for Nanites will expand exponentially. Although they currently require at least a mild electric field to remain functional, due to their composition any number of subtle shifts in their constitution could lead to them being powered either by photovoltaic or piezoelectric means.&#x20;
