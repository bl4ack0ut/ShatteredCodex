# Spear

The most common and the most practical of the shards in effect. The energy Spear shards emit has more ameliorative consequences. Namely, lengthly exposure causes subjects to have a high degree of focus. As a result their speed, both mentally and physically is dramatically increased. They process vast quantities of data extremely rapidly and move through spaces and activities at rates never seen.
