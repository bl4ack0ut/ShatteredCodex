# Amalgam Shards

With the mass quantities of ore being mined and purified, the Guild has been finding aberrations in raw Eonite being refined at Pylon. After some strange behaviors were observed in workers who handled the raw forms of these amalgamated deposits Guild scientists began processing them separately and subsequently discovered each possesses unique properties. They gave each amalgamation a name: Spear, Temple, Riot, and Phantom.
