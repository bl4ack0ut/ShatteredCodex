# Riot

Riot shards, not as rare as Phantom, are still difficult to come across and are perhaps most dangerous of all. Riot shard exposure is 200 proof steroids. Aggression is increased dramatically, power of motion is accentuated, but unlike the Temple shards, there is a high degree of uncertainty and difficulty in controlling the outcome. When directed and given no other outlet, for example when given to early miners, their ability to move through rock or any other obstacle was unsurpassed.
