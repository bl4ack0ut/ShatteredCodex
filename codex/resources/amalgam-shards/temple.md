# Temple

Temple are the second most common of the shards. Extended exposure has been likened to being injected with liquid iron. The body becomes stronger, more resistant to pain and damage. The mental changes are almost as fascinating: a very powerful urge to protect others, most especially the less powerful, and to enact swift justice in the face of wrong doing. A combination of Spear and Temple exposure has been assumed for high order Nocturne warriors.
