# Peristrophite

First discovered about hundred years ago in minute quantities on various remote planets and embedded in some asteroids, it's value was very high, but use very limited due to it's novelty. When testing revealed the composition of the mineral to be layered ferromagnetic and non-magnetic materials it's potential utility in nano-oscillators was theorized. However, once larger quantities were obtained the true revelation of the material's wonder became clear. Peristrophite possesses an usually large amount of anisotropic magnetoresistance making it the ideal material for essential technology functions including, but not limited to, neuromorphic computing.&#x20;

The value of the material has resulted in an economy being built around it's mining and collection on the Felaxian moon Spanios. The operators there guard the out flow of the mineral very tightly in an attempt to retain a high price on it's distribution. However, guarding an entire moon at all times is a difficult task and there are occasionally daring and desperate raids made in an attempt to abscond with a quantity of the substance to sell on the black market.
