# Teknite

Essential element of construction, Teknite is fabricated into beams, sheets, wire, rods, and all manner of other supplies. The pure metal is lustrous, non-corrosive, and silvery with a slight iridescent sheen when polished. Electrical, magnetic, and heat conduction are high—the majority of electrical wiring is made from fine spun Teknite. Known from other planets in low abundance previously, it was originally realized to exist on Pytheas as a by-product of eonite mining and is a highly-valued raw material. It is acquired by collecting, crushing, and smelting ore. Its melting temperature is high. Localized smelting is typically accomplished via induction furnace, and forging of materials will use a similar process. However, for large scale construction materials fabrication, only massive facilities are able to precisely control the annealing process of the metal to extract the most desired properties from it. Like all metals, adjustments to its properties can be accomplished by controlling the speed and arrangement of crystal formation during production—annealing, normalizing, and quenching. A unique aspect of Teknite that makes it desirable is that through very precise processing, grain size and structure placement can be achieved to a near flawless degree. The metal can be given both uniformity and equiaxed microstructure, resulting in isotropy. Yet, this isotropic fabrication is not required to be uniform throughout the entire piece. Therefore, a fabricator can not only have great control over the ductility, hardness, malleability, and tensile strength of a piece of metal, but can actually adjust these properties’ location within a single piece of metal. In short, specific crystalline arrangements can be fashioned during fabrication giving manufacturers the ability to create metal pieces that have user-desired properties.
