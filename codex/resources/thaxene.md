# Thaxene

A naturally occurring, inorganic gas found broadly throughout the galaxy and discovered in pocketed deposits in the crust of Pytheas. Its natural tendency to degrade under the effects of galactic cosmic radiation, and the inherent difficulty of shielding the gas from said radiation, means it is rarely transported through space, but rather mined from the planets upon which it is needed. The process of drilling for Thaxene can be both complicated and dangerous, though the new technologies the Guild is distributing on Pytheas have eliminated much of the burden. The flammable, highly energy dense, and clean burning nature of Thaxene makes it ideal for on-planet, non-FTL propulsion; landspeeders, Outbounder, and hoverships. In addition, it serves the purpose of a gas for use in welding applications during construction, repair, and manufacture, and has even been used in a select few defensive and weapon applications.
