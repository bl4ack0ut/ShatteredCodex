# Elaston Powder

Produced on the shores of methane seas, this product of near infinite grinding is capable of producing durable, flexible, and minutely accurate parts. Much of the value comes from the uniformly shaped particles—every grain of Elaston on the shores is spherical.&#x20;

In addition to this, so long as the grains are exposed to methane they remain exceptionally hard, thus creating the perfect wear. However, once removed from that environment their chemical composition alters slightly, shedding much of the brittleness and acquiring a prized level of elasticity—parts can slightly deform without breaking and will return to their original shape. This elasticity is further enhanced by the bonding between individual grains and the material's readiness to attract smaller grains to settle in interstitial gaps.
