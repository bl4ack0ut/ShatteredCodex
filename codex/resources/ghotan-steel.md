# Gho'tan Steel

Famed for its use in Al'golian plating, Gho'tan Steel is a closely guarded secret which only exists on a select few planets that orbit dangerously close to their suns. The true rarity arises not just from the location of the alloy, but from the necessity to collect it at the planet's terminator prior to solidification. As the star's fiery heat passes, the molten metal is harvested and immediately cast into molds. The crystallization matrix rapidly sets and therefore provides very little work time. Many "Whalers," as the collectors are often called, suffer injuries on the job and fatalities are not uncommon. But the steel is so highly prized for use in ship armor, workers are never in short supply.&#x20;

The wonders of Gho'tan are unmatched among known single construction physical shielding. It absorbs nearly all low-power energy weapon blasts without damage, deflects light caliber munitions, and is impervious to all but the most continuous or powerful ordinance.
