# Eonite

Discovered by the stranded Kyroskia Guild members 1000 years ago, this luminous element has only ever been found on Pytheas and once littered the surface of the planet. The composition of Eonite, though studied by dedicated Guild scientists for hundreds of years, is still understood in only a limited way by them, and, owing to the highly secretive nature of the Guild, is understood to almost no degree at all by the public. What is known is that the material has a natural, low level, non-ionizing radiation when undisturbed, making it a relatively safe material to be exposed to during transport. In fact, because of the difficulty of long space travel, one of the initial uses of EON was as a vitamin D production inducer and heat source due to the UVB radiation it produces. This was, of course, before it’s real significance was discovered. Once a stimulus is introduced the result is remarkable. The closest analogy that has been offered is that it is something akin to the piezoelectric effect taking place—a process by which mechanical energy applied to a crystal results in an electrical output. Purified Eonite ([EON](broken-reference)) crystals however have an output that seems to radically surpass expectations. It has been determined that the crystals are not providing “free energy”, but rather, are capable of acting as impossibly long-lasting deep-cycle lattice batteries. Thusly, when the ore is processed at the [Refinery](../../imperial-guild/pylon-the-refinery.md), the crystal absorbs and stores a quantity of energy that enables FTL drives, TerraMechs, and every power hungry device and outpost to function fluidly. The Eonite crystals can be hydraulically pressed, struck with high powered lasers, placed in gravity constrictors, or put in any number of other interactive environments to obtain their stored reserves. Depending on use, a pure Eonite edge\* has a lifespan estimated to range 25-50 years (though it could be burned in 1 under heavy strain and constant FTL travel or have output for a hypothesized 10,000 years or more if only used as heat and UVB radiation). The miracle ore’s properties do not end with power. It is also used to create Onosia and now some oddly tinted shards, that seem amalgamated, are being discovered. After a thousand years the depths of the lattice’s power still being uncovered. &#x20;

\*an “edge” of Eonite is a specific size and shape of the crystal—the most common and the smallest size—and is typically used to power small freighters, living quarters, or mechanical equipment.
