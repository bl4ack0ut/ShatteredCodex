# Halogens

Certainties regarding the Halogens are scant. Seven are believed to exist; the same seven who survived and were rescued from the surface of Pytheas over 900 years ago: members of the Kyroskia Space Guild.

Their power has become something of mythos. It is said that they can move at the speed of sound, feel no pain, and see through the darkest gambits. No Guild business, and perhaps nothing in the entire galaxy, happens without their knowledge. Information is fed to them through thousands of spies and confidential operatives. They command vast fleets, design deadly weapons, and orchestrate politcal upheavals. The Guild controls the galactic economy and space freight through the supply and refinement of eonite.

The depths of their activities and truth regarding their individual identities and histories will likely never be known by the public. The records destruction and elimination of all sources of history has been both systematic and thorough.
