# Pylon (The Refinery)

The Refinery is the next great leap forward for the Imperial Guild in their move towards total hegemonic control of the galaxy. An engineering masterpiece of mythical proportions, their engineers have completely converted a planet orbiting near a super massive black hole at center of the galaxy into an ore processing facility. The planet, named Pylon, has been outfitted with a series of the largest FTL drives known to exist. They are used to keep the Refinery positioned in a static position with the black hole’s plasma jets. They also serve to prevent the Refinery from falling, inexorably, into the black hole itself and being obliterated. The interior of the planet is, if possible, more impressive. The center has been converted to funnel and capture the incredible output of the singularity and to convert that collimated jet into refining power to purify the raw Eonite ore that is delivered there.&#x20;

\[The power arises from the forced combination of electrons and positrons which make up the jet, thereby releasing high energy gamma decay particles that force drive the mechanics and super heat the Eonite ore. This jet is also used to blow the dross out from the refinery. Due to the highly radioactive nature of the gamma particles there is a massive amount of specialized shielding that has had to be built into Pylon’s interior and thus the massive undertaking has cost an inestimable amount]
