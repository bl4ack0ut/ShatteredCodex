# Captain's Quarters

It may appear as little more than a simple tower, buried within the rocky surface, but a Captain’s Quarters is the heart of operations for an O’ru Ai-Lax. Sound-proofed containment allows for the complete elimination of distractions and prying ears from outside. Viewscreens line the interior walls, connected through the Evrys and backed by extremely high speed processors, they are capable of displaying real-time 3D star charts with ship positions and telemetry data. The feed is unparalleled for both accuracy and customizability. Pirate Lords can also run high-level encrypted video transmissions to enable planning without fear of spies. The room is also biolocked, like much of the Orbital Outpost’s sensitive areas and has a passive, constant electronic device sweeping system to prevent any unauthorized data capture. A large sized Nitech desk serves the occupant with comfortable, but minimalist furniture and a centralized table provides a surface for any in-person conferences.
