# Machinist Bay

For whatever reason, a great many Ai-Lax are inherently gearheads. The Machinist Bay is something of a paradise for this subset of Pirates and the Machinist Bay is their palace. Internal, automated storage of specialty tools and wall-mounted magnetic moldings for all the commonly accessed hardware make efficiency incredibly high and clears the path for focus on the work at hand. A database terminal, connected through The Evrys to download and share schematics, with Nitech pads and holographic 3D projector displays allows for detailed analysis of the complex machinery contained within the space crafts. Thereâ€™s also a welding and fabricating corner for when parts are hard to come by or something brand new needs building. Lifts are built into the ceiling and floor, benches retract from the walls, and hoses are at regular easy to access locations for all pneumatics. And, for the most delicate parts, a clean room is set off with all the micro-manipulation, chemical, and electrical tools one could possibly need. The entrance to the Bay is enclosed with a plasma window of sufficient strength to keep atmosphere contained, while allowing the passage of ships and cargo.
