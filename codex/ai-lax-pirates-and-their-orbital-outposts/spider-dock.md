# Spider Dock

Retractable structures on an Orbital Outpost. Depending on the degree of advancement "legs" are added around the asteroid. Ultimately, the Spider Dock allows for the connection of up to eight pirate captain ships. The hexagonal rigid tubes utilize a telescoping design composed of woven mesh fiber embedded in a hardened metal alloy. The genius of this design is that the slight flex created by positive pressure when the docking procedure is complete locks the mesh and metal segments together creating a thoroughly rigid structure capable of keeping vessels in the desired alignment. Teknite wire pulley systems allow for shifts of positioning when necessary, and docked craft are also held in place with the Outpostâ€™s attractor ray for added security. All this construction ensures that the fighters, so long as they remain docked, move as one with the asteroid. When the time comes for the ships to depart, an individual "leg" is lightly depressurized, recapturing a portion of the valuable atmosphere, unlocking the segments from one another, before being retracted back into the Orbital Outpost "body".
