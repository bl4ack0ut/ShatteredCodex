# Spider Dock

The only retractable structure on an Orbital Outpost. Depending on the degree of advancement, a Spider Dock allows for the concurrent connection of up to eight ships. The hexagonal rigid tubes utilize a telescoping design composed of woven mesh fiber embedded in a hardened metal alloy. The genius of this design is that the slight flex created by positive pressure when the docking procedure is complete locks the mesh and metal segments together creating a thoroughly rigid structure capable of keeping nearly any ship in the desired alignment. Teknite wire pulley systems allow for shifts of positioning when necessary, and docked craft are also held in place with the Outpostâ€™s attractor ray for added security. All this construction ensures that any docked craft, so long as they remain docked, move as one with the asteroid. When the time comes for the ships to depart, the legs of the dock are lightly depressurized, recapturing a portion of the valuable atmosphere, which also unlocks the segments from one another, before being retracted back into the central hub, or body.
