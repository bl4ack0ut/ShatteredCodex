# War Chest

The War Chest is the prime space storage solution—rigid, dense, and expandable. O’ru Ai-Lax are able to segregate assets into any of multiple rooms to limit who has access and when. This cellular design allows for the concurrent housing of weapons, precious assets, resources, and any other object which needs protection or limited contact. Programmable biosensor and time-based locks provide exceptional security from raiders and thieves. The power systems for the locking mechanisms are supplemented with backup batteries to provide continued functionality in the event of electrical disconnection, and should the system fail to be recharged the bolts will only be retractable with a combination key and custom analog key pad. Every eventually has been considered in the design to ensure security. In addition to all of these safekeeping measures, each War Chest is custom fit to each base with anchoring filaments threaded throughout in such a way as to require complete destruction of the asteroid should a raiding party wish to make off with the entire Chest.
