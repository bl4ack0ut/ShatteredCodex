# Engineering Bar

The exploratory equivalent of the Machinist Bay, the Engineering Bar is a cut above the workshop. It takes the unique tools and processors and puts them at the fingertips of anyone inventive and knowledgable enough to put them to use. Here are housed zero-tolerance fabrication machines, micrometer precision lasers, and a superconduction booth among many other toys. Zekmaw Orbs, mimic drones, syncopation grenades, and Algolian plating are all expressions of Ai-Lax inventors. Production benches, antistatic boxes, and specialty lab equipment are also available, not to mention an oversized cryogenic condenser for ice cold drinks on tap.
