# Faction Den

A Faction Den will adequately house any Pirates from the temporary alliances formed. But it also prevents any unfettered access to the rest of the Outpost by running full body scans of newly arrived Pirates, including but not limited to body heat signature, heart rhythm, and retinal scan profiles. Any visitors going anywhere within the base are tracked to prevent unauthorized access to weapons and cargo. This largely transparent geodesic structure allows for a clear view of all that is transpiring in the surrounding space and has sleeping cots and all the necessaries of life built into the walls. Biolocking secure storage is available in the event of multiple unrelated crew being housed. In the event of conflict the Den can be hermetically sealed and either a knockout or fast-acting poison gas can be released to effectively end any issues.
