# Ai-Lax Pirates (and their Orbital Outposts)

The most insidious, violent, unscrupulous thieves in the galaxy. They once circled Pytheas, stalking Miners who attempted to flee, blockaded and taxed the route to cargo ships, and fearlessly shanghaied new arrivals. Their Kakain Space Chariots are fast, nimble, and possess powerful attractor rays for capturing the non-compliant. The organization is loose, but the strongest reign with authority and take their cut of the spoils in any endeavor. Like everyone else, Onosia is their drink of choice when they can get their hands on it. When they can’t, a fermentation eternally plagued by acetobacter is their only alternative libation, resulting in an ever-present mild scent of vinegar. Though space pirates have always existed in the galaxy, no one seems to know how the Ai-Lax became the force they are today. All that is knows is that when the Colonist-Miners arrived, the Pirates seemed to appear too.

As a consequence of the SkyCutter Peace Treaty between the Imperial Guild and the Ai-Lax Pirates, the blockade in the space surrounding Pytheas is no longer in effect. A number of Pirate Lords (known as O’ru Ai-Lax) have constructed for themselves and their subordinate or affiliated Captains several hundred Outposts in the [Vyzallid Asteroid Belt](../universe/aldria-galaxy/sitorian-quadrant/omorphia-system/vyzallid-belt.md). The architects of the bases took a page from the Guild scientists who crafted the refinery planet Pylon, in that they have utilized large gauge laser drills to bore through the rock, carving out living and working spaces. Buried within the superstructure are all the necessities for life on the barren rocks: carbon dioxide scrubbers, water recyclers, waste processors, and biotic nutrient growth tanks. An eonite driven energy generation plant keeps the lights on and powers the shield generators to deflect the inevitable collisions that result from inhabiting an asteroid field. A number of turrets are mounted around the asteroid at strategic locations, especially near the ship docking locations in order to clear a pathway for departing spacecraft, but also at several other points as defensive deterrents for anyone foolish enough to attempt a siege. In addition to the shields the asteroids are equipped with boost engines to ensure ideal positioning within the belt and a number of attractor rays to allow for capture and positioning of other, smaller asteroids around the base. These extra asteroids serve a duel purpose: a kind of additional protective shielding for attack or impacts and as camouflage to further obscure the base’s location, should unwelcome outsiders happen to pass by. Everything about the Orbital Outpost is built for isolation, defense, and obscurity.
