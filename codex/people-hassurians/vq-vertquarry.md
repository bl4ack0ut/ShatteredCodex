# VQ (VertQuarry)

This underground resistance group of Colonists are disgruntled with the manner in which the Imperial Guild runs the economy and operations of Pytheas, Pylon, and all associated realms. They engage in acts of sabotage, information theft, and subversion. They are segregated and compartmentalized in such a way as to be functionally untraceable from one group to another. Their stated aim is the downfall of the Halogens and the freeing of Pytheas so that it may be controlled by and shared by the people who live and work there.
