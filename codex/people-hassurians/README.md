# People (Hassurians)

Original occupants of the planet Hassur. A number of different factions, with different ideologies and skill sets escaped the doomed sphere. These disparate communities eventually grouped off world mostly according to what their "tier" placement on Hassur had been and less by their culture.  These groups eventually grew and changed and shifted over time, developing their own new cultures and societal constructs. The three primary groups are catalogued separately (i.e. the Imperial Guild, Ai-Lax Pirates, and Colonist-Miners).
