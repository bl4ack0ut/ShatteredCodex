# Sa'tek

Ruthless, brilliant Ai-Lax pirate who left buccaneering, purchased the planet Mati, and established the incredibly successful security system business Omsatek. He used his knowledge of the methods and techniques of the Ai-Lax to create mesh network countermeasure ecosystems. Both hated by the Ai-Lax, who consider his business a betrayal, and suspiciously regarded by the rest of the populace, who worry that he is still working with the Pirates to infiltrate locations galaxy-wide, Saâ€™tek lives a reclusive and heavily securitized existence.
