# Training Field

Pytheas is a wild and dangerous place. Inhabitants of the planet need to know how to defend themselves and their property. The Training Field is where the physical skills are acquired and perfected. This transparent structure can contain everything needed to develop elite warriors—weight training area, sports equipment, climbing wall, combat ring, weapons vault, CQB live fire range, and tactical simulation zone with training weapons. There are holographic projection trainers available. These virtual instructors are able to model maneuvers and the 3D body mapping technology can capture trainee motion and then display the necessary adjustments needed to accomplish the techniques precisely. The programmed library of historic tactics and combat is both wide and deep. Much of the Field’s equipment is mobile to allow for easy reconfiguration when larger open spaces or different training regimens are needed.
