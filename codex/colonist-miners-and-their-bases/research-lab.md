# Research Lab

The core of all Colonist derived advancements in technology. The Research Lab is a combination garage, engineering studio, fabrication station, and biology bench. The equipment allows one to pursue the intellectual investigations of the physical world and craft them into reality. Everything from the microscopic nanite drones to the replacement of the Outbounderâ€™s driveshaft with a new lightweight Teknite composite will be accomplished here. This is also the location where a majority of the skills acquisition for Colonists will take place via the Basin. Everything is modular and recessable. Subfloors can be developed to allow for experimentation and storage that require the space or environment. Ideas become reality in the lab.
