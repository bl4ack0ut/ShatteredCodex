# Colonist-Miners (and their Bases)

These denizens occupy outlying planets and are the risk takers of galaxy. Having heard the call of the Imperial Guild, they abandoned their homes and bolted through space to acquire a mining claim on Pytheas. Pure grit and determination, self-reliant to a fault, everything is against them. The Imperial Guild rules over their claims, Ai-Lax Pirates raid their shipments, and the environment is ruthlessly hostile to life. Nevertheless they persevere. Before the acquisition of ARPS, they manage to survive in the desolate landscape by spending the vast majority of their time underground in the Eonite mines or in their hodgepodge structures. The more politically- and strategically-minded regularly circulate the idea of forming a military force in opposition to the Pirates, and in hushed back rooms the formation of a controlling, unifying force to oppose Guild rule has been whispered. No event or leader has emerged to galvanize such a massive undertaking though the VQ is making a concerted effort in that direction.
