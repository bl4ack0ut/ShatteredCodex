# A.B.F

With the need for a sustainable method of acquiring rations the Guild has developed the Alchemic Botanical Farm (ABF). A combination nutrient farm and laboratory reminiscent of the common greenhouse modules that are in operation on 10,000 systems across the galaxy. Those common modules vary in size and shape, but the processes are alike—substrate, liquid grow medium (the combination of nutrients, water, and beneficial bacteria), and lighting. ABF however have the upgradable capacity to differ substantially in form and capability. The interior grow space is completely modular, with space for stacked plant beds; suspended, inverted planters; and tower gardens. There are nanometer, multistage, selectable filtering systems—instantly, digitally reroutable based on user requirements for delivering the proper nutrient containing fluid to the plants. Wireless probes capable of detailing chemical and nutrient shortages on a cellular level give instant feedback on biological requirements, while microdrones laser prune and pollinate to ensure optimal growth rates and production. Sterilization foggers are embedded in the entry port as well as the roof interstices for use in case of contamination. Programmable, full-spectrum led lighting; sectional temperature control; and humidifiers provide near infinite adjustability for optimum, individualized, growth conditions. A straightforward UX grants access to genetic analysis, splicing, and recombination tools. In addition to all the available organizational and operational aspects of the ABF, the entirety of the laboratory equipment, shelves, hoods, and staging areas are able to be recessed into the floors and walls of the module to allow for a complete open and accessible floorplan. The immense and stable energy supply provided by eonite makes for a powerful workspace. Fully optimized units are said to be capable of providing sustenance comfortably for a large population.
