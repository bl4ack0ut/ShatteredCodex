# Sat Tower

A proverbial dragnet for any and all energetic activity within the area surrounding ARPS compounds, as well as incoming distantly generated communications. The primary arrays are standard antennae and satellite dishes to capture radio and microwaves. They can be upgraded and tuned to enable clear signal acquisition from the entire host of the electromagnetic spectrum from ULF to UHF. The dishes are also capable of being collapsed and retracted into the hub of the module to allow for repairs, alterations, upgrades, and protection in the case of meteorite showers or any other detrimental external forces. This module is the eyes and ears for any Pythean with a speck of self interest.
