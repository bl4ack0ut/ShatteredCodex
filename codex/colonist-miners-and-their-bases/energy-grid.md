# Energy Grid

Electrical center of the ARPS and associated modules. Routing energy effectively is a delicate process. There are three primary aspects for Colonists to be aware of: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution. Generation is a multifaceted approach. The base load is handled by thermophotovoltaic cell conversion of eonite crystal radiation as this is a consistent stable method of energy generation. For intermediate load, the grid’s roof can be equipped with high efficiency solar panels that can directly feed the usage requirements of the base, or be stored in rapid-charge graphene battery packs. This allows for instant in-fill during times of heavy load draw. For times of peak load, especially during unexpected heavy draw, such as base defense or in case of multi-day long sandstorms during which solar generation is heavily impeded, there are Thaxene-driven back-up generators that can be installed on a subfloor where it is shielded from outside disruption. Generated electricity is transmitted from the grid module to all other buildings through heavily insulated, high current lines. However, prior to this distribution, electricity must pass through a module’s dedicated transformer built into the Energy Grid’s main structure to step up or down voltage following production. Upgrades to the system can enable direct user-controlled distribution of power output to more effectively prioritize usage and manage production. Management and maintenance of the Energy Grid is essential to the continued operation of any base. This module is also the sole location for the collection and assemblage of Nanites. They will need to be periodically harvested in order to avoid interference with the processes of the grid. Once collected, they require electrically-bounded containment to avoid degradation.
