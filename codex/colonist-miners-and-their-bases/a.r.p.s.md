# A.R.P.S

The Autonomous Rapid Prospecting System (A.R.P.S.), an Imperial Guild invention, has been in design and testing for decades. It is one of the primary drivers behind the expansion of Eonite mining on Pytheas (the other of course being the completion of the Refinery: Pylon). These units are specifically crafted to withstand the rigors of existence on the surface of Pytheas: the intense heat of day, frigid night temperatures, intermittent micrometeorites, and the blasting sand and dust. The structures are composed of hardened metal alloy coated with an Eonite-ceramic layer. This combination results in units that are both corrosion-resistant and nearly impervious to all normal environmental forces found on Pytheas.\
The A.R.P.S. system has an in-built, centrally-located portal in its base. This ring-shaped opening serves two purposes. The primary function of the mechanism is as a ported Emdrive system that harnesses the CoandÄƒ effect to generate multiplicative thrust in atmospheric environments. The secondary function is as an aperture through which mining operations take place. Once landed, a series of clamps are deployed which secure the A.R.P.S. to the substrate. The central aperture dilates to allow direct access to the surface and the drilling lasers to begin their work. A central mining shaft is sunk directly down into the surface through a process of laser-vaporization boring. This is, however, a very energy intensive process for which each A.R.P.S. is equipped to accomplish once without replacement of the eonite energy crystal. The ore mined by the unit is primarily focused on Teknite and rEON extraction. The Teknite ore is ground fine and passed through an extremely high-powered induction coil (EHPIC), stratified for purification, and cast into bars for future use in construction and manufacture. As a consequence of this mining procedure, as certain amount of Thaxene is also released from the rock and captured for use as a combustible gas.\
These systems are both expandable and modular. They will offer, to the enterprising Colonist, the capacity for the addition of a variety of different outbuildings, some connected by enclosed corridors, some not. The entire system will allow for enclosed living and working on the surface of Pytheas. Some examples of expansion modules are a location for dedicated Pyroleum and Thaxene extraction, for research, and for horticulture. The materials requirements for running such a base unit will continue to grow with its expansion and complication and therefore will also require an increased acquisition of resource variety (not simply the rEON mining of times past).
