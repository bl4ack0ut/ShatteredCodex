# The Exploits of Oorla

Everything on Yeratak-1 is difficult. The mountains are glass. Our water is bitter. Even the air fights against being breathed. We call our military force the Ten-Kala-Mandins, the Warriors Dipped in Fire. Only fighters more feared in the galaxy are the Imperial Guild’s Order of the Nocturne. They’re 50,000 light years away, and the Guild doesn’t care about us anymore.&#x20;

I live on the southern edge of the highest mountain, Rotaula Prime, on the outskirts of the second largest city. Once well-populated, inhabitants have been bleeding off Yeratak for a couple hundred years now, ever since Eon became the dominant power source in the galaxy. We still mine Kovolite, the main power source prior to the proliferation of Eon, and a lot of poorer and outlying systems still use it. So we live, bleeding.&#x20;

Mining is brutal, tearing apart the hyaline rock throws microscopic shards into the air, and though workers wear respirators and full shielding you can’t avoid tracking it on clothing, bringing it home, eating it in your food.&#x20;

My father was a high-level mining engineer and short hop cargo pilot for the major local company here for 20 years. He’d say, “Someday my oorla” oorla was an old word for one who causes trouble, his word of love for me, “someday, you will be like our mountain glass to the Guild, unseen, piercing, and a terminus to their future.” He gave me a vial filled with the mining dust on a strap to wear around my neck. He said it was so I would never forget. He died in a mining collapse a month later.&#x20;

\------------

They’re after me. I knew I should have shrugged off, it was too obviously a setup, undercovers all around. A corner, there’s a doorway on the other side, to the roof. Go go go. So hard to breathe at a full run, I didn’t have the funds to get a new filter this morning and this one’s a week old. Stupid stupid. Door’s locked. I hear their comms echoing. Think think...I’m scanning through my HUD map on my visor...wait, there, up the street through that alley, there’s an open drain gate that leads to the underground. I’m at full speed and legs are burning. There! That’s it. That’s...too small. No, I can fit. Gotta fit. A yard out I breathe deep, rip off the helmet, hit its collapse button, hipslide across the ground, roll to feet-first, stretched out, arms straight, and like a snake in a downspout I’m through.&#x20;

Below, I catch my footing, expand my visor and slip it on to get my breath back. It’s dark, the only light comes through the grate. Pounding feet as Mandins blast past above.&#x20;

I flick on my lightwand to it’s lowest setting, touch the vial under my shirt to make sure I didn’t lose it in the slide, and go around a bend in the tunnel. Remove the hardcase strapped between my shoulder blades, key in the access code, and slowly the iridescent green glow fills the tunnel.

\------------

At the den, I stand before Tarkon while he holds the open case. “An absolutely pure Eon crystal.” His voice is guttural, fat, and phlegmy. “Well done young lady, you are my finest thief.” He reaches out to stroke my hair with a sausagey hand, but I slip away, slapping the meaty paw in the process. His face turns sour. “Men,” he turns to his bodyguards, “put her in a cell until I decide how to adjust her attitude.”&#x20;

\------------

Dank and dark, I’m without filters, though thankfully air is cleaner this far down. Everything is quiet. Dripping somewhere, and I can hear the skittering of some small creature. I slide the sole off my right shoe and remove the rubberized thumb print impression I’d taken from Tarkon weeks ago as insurance. Reach through the bars, press it against the biolock to the cell, and slide the door open.

I’ve cast a die. Feel the vial against my skin, hear my father’s voice, and move down the hallway in silence.&#x20;

Cell guard is sleeping with a half-empty bottle of some foul-smelling stuff at his feet. He has my visor on a shelf above his head. I remove it, expand the helmet so I can bring up the HUD and A/V enhancement and get some cleaner air.&#x20;

Down the hall I hear Tarkon sleeping, it sounds like he’s drilling through solid metal. With the same fingerprint I open the door, thankful it’s silent too. In a bedside alcove I see my pack. The heft tells me the crystal is still inside. A book is open. His journal entry. Skimming through. He travels...he sells...he kills...details...terrible details...wait. He has a ship. An eonite powered ship. Hidden in a hanger across town. Now, nothing else matters but getting away.&#x20;

Almost out of the room when my HUD picks up an inconsistency in the far wall. A seam. Feel across the surface...there, my false print hits the sensor. A metallic thunk of a bolt sliding back. I whip my head around as Tarkon rolls. I’m frozen. He seems to settle back in sleep. Inside the panel are morphic credentials to let you be anyone and an eon funds pass with enough to run. His emergency go kit. You sly whale, I think.&#x20;

“Yes, indeed” from behind me. Tarkon is awake, his disruptor aimed at my head.&#x20;

“Lights up,” he croaks. “Yes, I am leaving Yeratak. Preparing to begin again elsewhere. I was going to make you cry in pain for striking me, but now that you know this...well there is only one remedy. Good bye, child.”&#x20;

“Flash Night!” I yell. It’s the code programmed into my helmet to erupt a blinding light. At the same moment I duck and roll. The wall where my head stood is a singed melting slump. Tarkon begins firing wildly, melting holes in his room left and right. I’m dashing down the halls. Left, right, I can hear his voice bellow incredibly loud behind me “MY EON! GET HER!” Every gangster in his outfit will be awaked by that. Have to get to the hanger. No other way.

\------------

I’m flying across the city, running through shadows, hitching momentary rides on the backs of vehicles. I know Tarkon will have called out every gangster and henchman and affiliate in the city to look for me. He’s probably in the sky himself in a Helicalcopter scanning the streets.&#x20;

Screens everywhere are suddenly blaring, all showing the same thing on repeat, I’m trying to catch it while moving, trying to avoid the glow they cast. Something about an announcement. I tune my helmet’s audio receiver from a comms scanner to try and find it. It’s everywhere.&#x20;

“...our great planet await you.&#x20;

Effective immediately, the Imperial Guild hereby proclaims that we will open the portals and land to Pytheas for 10,000 mining claims. Anyone seeking to obtain such a claim must arrive in orbit around the planet Pytheas, submit valid credentials, and pay a requisite fee to the Guild for claim. As a condition of receipt, all processing of ore will be done through only the Pylon Refinery by the Guild. All mining parcels will be acquired on a first arrival basis. The riches of our great planet await you.&#x20;

Effective immediately, the Imperial Guild...” I turned it off. I knew where I was going now.&#x20;

\------------

At the hanger location I have to go in through the roof, there are guards at the entrances. Through a break in the fence line, across an open space, and up a series of ledges. There’s a loose pane in the skylight roof glass, I can remove it and get through. The distance down to the closest ship below is far, but I think I can make it without breaking my legs.&#x20;

I land with a heavy thud and an “Ummph!” Nothing broken, but I’m going to have bruises. Six ships in the hangar. It’s the black one, the smaller one on the far side, has to be—that vain fool wears nothing but black. I try the print at the hatch and it requires an access code...I flip filters on the HUD to see faint marks on used keys. It can’t be that easy, can it? 3-6-6. E-O-N. The hatch opens. What an idiot.&#x20;

Inside I begin systems check, but there’s no power registered. I slide off the hardpack, put in the code, pull out my crystal, and slide it into the waiting rack. The ship draws in the crystal like a mother wrapping her baby and everything suddenly turns on with such illumination my visor can’t adapt fast enough. The whir of the filtration systems evacuate the air and I pull my helmet off. It’s the cleanest air I’ve ever breathed. As though I’ve been underwater my whole life. I fly around the small ship making sure everything is set. There are rations in the cargo holds, everything is ready. I throw myself into the pilot’s seat, close the hatch way, and thanked the ghost of my father for taking me along when he would fly to the cargo freighters. Suddenly, the entire hanger erupts in blasts of light and sound, on the screens I see that a cohort of Mandins and Tarkon’s gangsters have entered the building from two ends and are firing, not at me, but at one another. The Mandins have been looking for Tarkon for decades. One blast goes wild and blows out the skylight above. I hit the lifters and out of the corner of my eye see Tarkon’s massive chest disappear on the monitor. Then I’m gone too.&#x20;

\------------

Ships are everywhere. I don’t know what to do but sit at the comms and wait. Documents in hand.&#x20;

Suddenly a voice bursts over the channel.&#x20;

“This is an official Imperial Guild clearance communication. State your purpose at Pytheas.”&#x20;

I touch the vial at my chest.&#x20;

“This is Colonist...Colonist Oorla. I’ve come to claim a mining parcel.”
