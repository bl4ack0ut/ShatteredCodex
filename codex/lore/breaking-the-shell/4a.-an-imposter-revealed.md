# 4a. An Imposter Revealed

Katrina Marshall was used to these long FTL trips. Regularly commissioned for cargo transfer for the IG, she could easily take a 60-hour flight without batting an eye. It wasn’t always easy though, being a Flight-Lieutenant took many hours of in-flight experience before you would feel comfortable moving through space at a couple thousand LYD. And the stress and focus required when moving that quickly made every rookie pilot she’d ever seen get queasy the first time out.

Which is why she was so perplexed by her wet-behind-the-ears copilot, Tober Motschick.&#x20;

“I can't believe how well you’re doing,” she said. “For your first long-distance flight you’re handling it like a pro.”

“I guess I’m just a natural,” the imposter Tober lied, flashing her a grin.

Katrina giggled in an almost bubbly way, which was quite uncharacteristic.

“Excuse me. Wow…I think I’m over-tired,” Katrina said through a timely yawn.

The Ai-Lax pirate masquerading as Pilot Motschick wasn't nearly as uncomfortable flying a freighter as he was pretending to be this weakling “Tober”. A seasoned veteran of flight and combat, FTL didn't make him sick but riding shotgun and pretending to be anything other than exemplary made him want to puke all over the controls.

“Why don’t you strap in and take a nap? We still have quite a ways to go and I can babysit the Prime’s autopilot for a while,” Fake Tober said.

Katrina had been awake nearly 48 hours at this point and wasn't going to argue.

"Sure thing, Tober,” she said. She strapped herself into her flight seat, ready to take a rest. Watching her copilot pace the bridge, she began to admire his confidence. Katrina hadn't really noticed before, but Tober was a good looking kid. She caught herself daydreaming of his hair and eyes as she dozed off…

“Encode: Course unchanged, speed unchanged. Transmit to Xibak’sor.”

Katrina awoke, but didn’t move a muscle. She’d only cracked her eyes slightly, not daring to be caught. Tober was pacing in front of the bridge’s view screen. She didn't understand, but she was positive she had heard him speaking in the ancient dialect exclusively used among the pirates…impossible, she thought.

Her hand removed the emergency blaster from its compartment hidden in the chair as she opened her mouth to speak, but never got the words out.

LIGHT!

BLINDING LIGHT!

The bridge, partially destroyed and separated from the hull, launched into the endless expanse.

Katrina was knocked unconscious from the blast. Her head had flung violently backward, had collided with her seat. She was completely oblivious that the ship was off axis and rotating violently through space.&#x20;

Dim backup lights flicker on and off…Katrina can almost make out words in her trauma induced slumber. It sounds like a voice deep under water…

_wrrring…wrriing…warning…warning…warning..WARNING!_

Snapping to consciousness, Katrina is suddenly aware of the situation. She yells to the ship's computerized controls.&#x20;

“Activate…Auto Pilot…emergency landing!” It’s difficult to get words out in the spin. “Take us to…the nearest planet!”

The Emergency Auto Pilot turns on the remaining port thruster, easing the gyrations, and navigates around a moon, avoiding catastrophic collision by moments.

Katrina realizes her copilot is missing.

“Tober!” She yells.&#x20;

“Flight-Officer Tober Motschick! Can you hear me?!”

No reply. Only the sound of thrusters.

After an eternity, the planet Euphrosyne swims up in the sea of black. This is the destination for the fragment of a spacecraft.&#x20;

No significant atmosphere slows the descent. The bridge skids across the green coated surface of a mountain top plateau, carving a valley in its wake. Ancient soil and bacterial growth, untouched by humanity from the beginning of time, peel off in chunks flinging into the air. Thruster and remaining shield generation decrease the angle of impact sufficient to keep the bridge from ripping apart.

She unbuckles her safety harness and moves to the central command station to attempt to reach the Imperial Guild Command.&#x20;

“MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY! Flight-Lieutenant Katrina Marshall, freighter captain of the Olepe Prime, operator number 010309. Command, we have crash landed on Planet…Euphrosyne, in the…Xathika system, do you copy?"

Nothing but static.

On the other side of what remains of the bridge, Katrina can see the lifeless body of her copilot wedged between a control panel and the secondary pilot seat.&#x20;

"Oh hell…Motschick…can you hear me?!” yelled Katrina.

His head had impacted the control panel and split open.

Reaching down to check his pulse, she is shocked to see the pilot's face. Despite the blood and filth she can see the person laying there is a complete stranger. The pilot she had been sitting beside, the same young pilot she was admiring, wore a clean shaven face and blonde, wavy hair. Now she was looking at a rough, battle-worn pirate. The imposter pilot’s black hair pulled into a braided ponytail and a detailed black and green tattoo crawled across his neck. The tattoo is odd, at first glance normal, yet there’s something…layered about it, but she can’t focus. The pieces of the situation connecting in her mind.&#x20;

"How could I be so blind?!” Katrina rushed back to the transceiver, “Guild Command, Olepe Prime, come in…come in…mayday mayday mayday. Reporting a missing pilot….Tober Motschick presumed prisoner on an Ai-Lax ship…a disguised pirate...dead…a ship…crashed."

Katrina reeled at the implications of this dead pirate on her bridge. She verged on passing out completely but slapped herself once, hard and fast across the right cheek and it snapped her mind back.

She refocused, and inspected the body for identification. A quick search revealed a broad necklace-like object around the pirate's neck, below the collar of the uniform.

It’s some kind of holographic disguise technology, she thought.

"Well, you won't be needing this anymore,” the Lieutenant said as she removed the device from the pirate’s neck and put it into her cargo pocket.

She patted down the corpse, checking for anything else that might help her better understand why or how a pirate was here in the first place. Some onosia bottle caps in the vest of the pirate, and a black, nasty looking disruptor was in a chest holster. She was feeling over the jacket one last time when something caught her eye.

Clipped to the inside bottom hem of the flight jacket was a small carbon fiber, scarab-shaped device. Intrigued, she plucked it off. This must be an Ai-Lax tracker, she thought. Probably keeping tabs on their man here.&#x20;

“Well, whoever you are, I may be screwed, but I’ll be damned if I let your greasy brigand friends find me or get any data on this mission.” With that she snapped the device in half, tossed it to the Prime’s floor, and ground it under her bootheel. And somewhere a long way off a green dot winked out of existence.

Katrina spent the next few hours trying to get power up. Everything failed. The transceiver had short circuited. Without power there was no chance of firing up the emergency beacon, which was her only remaining chance of getting off of this planet. Tired and defeated, she moved to the large opening in the wall where the hull used to be and gazed out on the planet for the first time.

The Prime had plowed across a mountain top plateau, atop a desolate landscape. On the horizon, jagged mountain peaks disappeared into the darkening sky. And as if all that weren't enough, her HUD indicated the air was unsafe.&#x20;

She tried to take it all in; crash landing, imposter copilot, this godforsaken planet. And she began weeping. Her perfect career as a freelance pilot for the Guild was over. This was her fate now.

She was stranded and certainly wouldn’t live long.

"No one's coming," she told herself as she stared into the night sky.

The mission was doomed from the start, she suddenly realized.&#x20;

So was I.

Katrina Marshall slumped to the floor of the bridge, her bridge, what was left of her ship, leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.
