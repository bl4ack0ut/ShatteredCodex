# 1. One Last Night in Paradise

Tober Motschick chose to spend his last night of shore leave in Paradise. He sat on one of the high-legged chairs loudly drinking and holding court.

Tober had been coming to Paradise with his dad since he was a snot-nosed, sniveling kid who’d pitch a fit if he didn’t win at darts and liked to pull wings off moths and drop their shorn, struggling bodies into people's drinks. And, as Jar would say, he’d only gone downhill from there. Tober’s dad worked his fingers to the bone to send his son to a prestigious pilot school. Tober repaid that kindness by claiming he was too busy to fly back when his dad contracted a terminal case of miner’s lung. Instead, sending a sorry and some cheap, knock-off onosia. His father died alone, somehow still full of praise for his errant son.&#x20;

Although more united in their dislike of Tober than nearly all other topics, the Paradise regulars left him alone out of a begrudging respect for the father. Each secretly hoped one day he would annoy some out-of-towner with no such loyalties.

One of the oldest regulars, Froggen, shuffles into Paradise. A man of habit, he makes his way towards his usual seat. Halfway there he spots Tober and quickly swerves.&#x20;

“Froggen!”

Too late.&#x20;

“You look older than hell, let me buy you a beer,” Tober shouts. “Might be my last chance before you join my dad.”

Froggen hesitates. Business is bad. His tab is high. Resigning to his fate, he sighs and turns back.

“Hello, Tober.”

Tober signs to Jar for two beers and flings an arm around Froggen’s neck. Froggen quickly shrugs it off.&#x20;

“Poor old Froggy, you look like crap, how's business?”

“It’s…” Froggen starts.

“Don’t bother fronting to me,” Tober cuts him off. “I walked past your yard today. No one there. Junk Food’s One Stop Shop opened right next door. That hurts, amiright?”

Froggen half-heartedly protests, but Tober continues loudly over him, “I _waaas_ gonna upgrade my Teknite harmonic balancer with you, for old times sake, but the deal Junk offered me…” Tober gives out a low whistle, “better than any friendship. Great place. Nice guy actually. You should work there,” Tober suddenly laughs in a high-pitched shrieking way.

Clenching his fists, driving his nails hard into his calloused palms, Froggen looks around for someone to save him. No luck. Everyone is on the other side of the bar, except a couple of tattooed Ai-Lax pirates sitting at a table nearby playing cards. And Mutey, the latest in a long line of vagrants to make Paradise their home, picking up jabbie ends. Jar would give him a beer when he’d filled the bucket as reward.&#x20;

Tober follows his gaze to Mutey.&#x20;

“Who is that?” he says curling his lip in disgust.

“We’ve been calling him Mutey, on account of him not speaking. He turned up a few weeks back. Another one gone. Mining accident. The bottle. Usual story.”

“Mutey,” Tober chuckles amused. He catches a glimpse of his reflection. He pauses. Then carefully runs his fingers through his slicked back hair. &#x20;

Hearing his name, Mutey stands up. His back hunched and stooped under a filthy hooded cloak, he unsteadily makes his way towards Tober, hopefully stretching out an ash stained palm.&#x20;

Tober looks up and recoils in shock at the figure that’s materialized next to him. Repulsed, he pushes it away with his boot. Already unsteady, Mutey stumbles backwards onto his bucket, spilling the carefully collected jabbie ends out on the floor.

“Parasitic scum,” Tober spits out, “you’ll have to make your own way in this galaxy, like I did. If you aren't up to it then go rot quietly in a corner. Or anywhere away from me.”

Tober takes a deep breath. Flicks a speck of dust off his jacket. Then turns back to Froggen, “You’ve not even asked me how I am?” and with barely a pause continues, “Well let me tell you, your boy is moving up in the world.”

Froggen pales at the thought of Tober being his boy.

“I’ve been hired to pilot an Imperial Guild cargo ship. Taking off tomorrow.”

Froggen glances over the bar to see if the beers are coming.

Annoyed, Tober tries again, “It's flying at double the speed of their normal cargo ships.” Froggen feigns a smile.

“There's more,” he says, an edge of desperation in his voice, and for a second Froggen sees a flash of the little boy who’d cry when his darts missed.

“There's a special mission.”

Froggen tries not to laugh. Of course Tober couldn't just be on a regular ship, oh no it had to have a “special mission”.&#x20;

Tober makes a pretense to look around and see who is listening, and then says in a mock whisper that carries like a shrill bell around the bar, “We’re collecting something from Anaxima.”

“Anaxima? The Guild science planet? I thought that was just a rumor. I’ve never heard of a cargo ship actually going there.”

“This one does. Not officially. Not in any records. But the real route we’ve programmed takes us right there for a pick up and after that…well even I don’t know.”

For the first time Froggen starts to listen.&#x20;

Seeing this, Tober excitedly continues. “All the rest of the cargo’s a smokescreen. Ship’s running a skeleton crew. I heard one of the Halogens was down at the loading bay. Whatever we’re going for, it’s a big deal. This is it. I can feel it. I’m finally playing with the big boys.”

Suddenly, Froggen becomes aware of an unusual silence. For a split second the whole bar is paused. Yet the moment Froggen looks around, everyone is back in action at the usual volume.&#x20;

He leans in closer to Tober, “If that’s true, you need to be more careful what you say.”

Tober slaps Froggen hard on the arm and produces another of those shriek-like peals of laughter, “You old fool, like anyone in here would do anything.”

Froggen glances at the Ai-Lax pair nearby. The card game has finished and the woman with long, braided hair whispers something into the man's ear. She smiles at Froggen and he quickly looks away.&#x20;

Thankfully, at that moment Jar lurches over and drops their beers roughly onto the bar. Froggen reaches out for his and gulps it down. His haste makes the sweet amber liquid splash down his chin. He surreptitiously wipes it off with the back of his hand.&#x20;

“So Froggy, how about we raise a glass to one last night in Paradise. Soon I’ll be sipping onosia at the High Guild table. Even as a kid I knew I’d never fade away in this backwater like the rest of you.” He picks up his glass, “To me. Making it,” he says, raising it high. &#x20;

Froggen looks at the upheld glass. Oh, how he wants to throw his beer in that smug face rather than drink to it.&#x20;

And the universe obliges. Mutey, his bucket finally full, trips over a discarded bottle on his way to the bar, sending him flying into Tober’s raised arm. The beer cascades out of the glass neatly into Tober’s face.

For once Tober is speechless. He stands frozen as sticky golden liquid drips down his face, slowly seeping into his jacket.&#x20;

Through gritted teeth he mutters “This…is…the regulation pilot jacket I have to wear tomorrow you drunk imbecile!”

Nervously, Mutey takes a soiled rag from his waist and hopelessly pats it over the jacket. This unfreezes Tober who promptly explodes in pure unadulterated rage.

“Don’t put your filthy beggar hands on me!” he screams. He swings the glass he still has raised down with all his power onto Mutey’s head. With a sickening crunch, froth and glass erupt into the air. Mutey immediately crumples. He lies face down, covered by his cloak. Silent. Unmoving. Just a dark, misshapen lump on the floor. The only evidence of his previous humanity is a small stream of red blood seeping out of his hood and mixing into the beer on the floor.&#x20;

Tober hasn't finished. He repeatedly kicks the lump that was Mutey. The lump makes no protest. All that can be heard is the squelch of Tober’s boot in the blood.&#x20;

He puts so much force into each strike, his whole frame shudders with the impact. Tober’s Nitech fumbles out of his jacket pocket along with some change and a scrap of paper.

“Come on Tober, it’s enough,” Froggen says, picking up the items. The change goes into his pocket, the paper has some strange writing on it, Froggen tries to break Tober’s focus by holding out the Nitech.

Tober ignores him, still kicking and swearing under his breath. His slicked back hair falls onto his forehead. Blood splatters his trousers. He is smiling.&#x20;

Jar prepares to make his way around the bar, when someone else intervenes.&#x20;

The Ai-Lax pirate woman suddenly appears next to Tober, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. Froggen looks at her table. The man is gone.&#x20;

“Don’t know why Jar lets trash like that in here,” she says in a strange foreign sounding lilt. ”Let me buy you a drink. A man of your standing must have an interesting tale or two to tell.”

Tober stops. He nods curtly at the woman, smoothes back his hair, wipes the blood off his boot, snatches the Nitech from Froggen’s outstretched hand, and allows himself to be led away for a drink. &#x20;

Froggen makes his way over to the other regulars, but is notably quiet the rest of the night. His attention is divided equally between examining the scrap of paper in his hand and watching Tober and the Ai-Lax woman.

He wonders if he should say something as he sees the Ai-Lax woman ply Tober with drink after drink, laughing and whispering in his ear.

He wonders if he should say something as he sees the Ai-Lax man return, quietly stick his head in the door of Paradise, make a sign to the woman, and slip out again.

He wonders if he should say something as he sees Tober, glassy-eyed and floppy-limbed, led out of Paradise like a compliant puppy, leaning on the woman's shoulder.

And he nearly does.

But he also sees the Mutey-shaped lump still silent, prostrate on the floor. Remembers Tober’s dad dying alone. Thinks of Tober boasting about buying his Teknite harmonic balancer from that two-bit shyster Junkfood. And he decides to let it be. An old fool doesn’t know anything worth saying anyway, right?
