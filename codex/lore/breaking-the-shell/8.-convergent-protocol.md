# 8. Convergent Protocol

As the moons of Omorphia orbit their guiding star and the bustling Imperial Guild freighters complete their shifts for the cycle, the otherwise cold and harsh vacuum of space seems slighted somehow. A feeling of dread and excitement that can't be explained in words alone. Somewhere out there is a story waiting to unfold between three unsuspecting factions and the individuals that align with them.

I am not yet important. What I know is vast and could be dangerous in the wrong hands. What I can tell you is that after this….nothing will ever be the same as it was in the Omorphia system just a few cycles ago.

It's been rumored that the IG acquired something mysterious on Pytheas. Many secrets are still left unanswered about how eonite came to be and Pytheas being the center for all of it, so the whispers of each faction fester in anticipation of what it could be. This also seems to have attracted the attention of the more undesirable denizens in the star system.

As the cargo freighter arrives, the air is thick with intrigue and eyes and ears begin to swivel in its direction. There seems to be a slight change in pace with some of the crew members near the loading bays and I can't help but wonder why that one particular pilot seems to be counting each of his steps so meticulously, as if this isn't one of the most important days of his life.

Being a curious mind, I tucked myself away in the ship that strange man was boarding to see if I could get a closer reading on the precious cargo. The container was sealed and encoded in such a way that…well I have never seen anything like it. Access may prove to be a difficult task so I will refrain for now. Seems like I'm needed elsewhere anyway…

Funny that the pilot doesn't seem to have any inclination of who her copilot actually is, maybe that’s on purpose due to the nature of the cargo…walls within walls…everything is layers of deception and covert activity…

I'll just leave some breadcrumbs to find my way back later and leave them be for now…

It took some doing, but I was finally able to hitch a ride on a passing Colonist vessel, although what they’re doing so far from Pytheas I cannot fathom. It seemed to be headed in a familiar direction and who am I to deny such a convenience. The hull was filled with labored breathing and words of corruption nesting in the Imperial Guild. They didn't even notice me.

This group of weathered souls, with their hands stained from their time in the mines of Pytheas and ship floor caked in green dust, seem to be on a mission of sorts.

After listening for a bit longer they changed course and are on their way to find a shipwreck at a distant planet, which is curious because it has the same details as the previous vessel I was on. Something seems to be happening, but what?

Need to gather more information...this will surely end in lives lost and I would be going against every bit of morality I have left if I don’t act soon.

I think I know where I need to be now…

Someone is interfering…interception and scanning…searching. I know this. It…it’s pirates.

They know something is wrong. Picked up the broadcasts and coded signals. Sharks, they smell blood in the water. It seems they are coming for prey. The power struggle never ends. I can’t stop it.

Who else are they reading? It’s not just Colonists, someone else is on the move…

It is as I feared, there's an elite Nocturne combat ship contingent approaching from the opposite end of the location the colonists are headed to. The soldiers on board have a glint in their eyes like they have seen death before and this is just another walk in the stars for them.

Their leader is still and emotionless, no comms, they speak to each other without words. The HUD indicates details from the shipment that I was first observing. What are they doing here? Why is this so important?

Everyone converging. It’s all happening at once.

I need to jump back onboard the cargo ship and alert them of what’s coming, but…wait…

My systems must be jammed, why can’t I access the onboard computer anymore?

A way out. I need a way out…
