# 4c. Tober's Legacy

Tober opens his eyes. Even the dim light is painful. His mouth is dry, lips cracked.

“Dad?” he croaks out in the silence.&#x20;

No reply.

He tries to piece his mind back together. Of course no reply, his dad is dead. He doesn’t need him. Tober is an Imperial Guild pilot who…it hits him…who has the most important job of his career today!

He sits bolt upright, pain firing through his temples, and then collapses backwards. I have no time for this. He manages to roll off the bed and kneels on the ground, his palms supporting him. The floor feels greasy. &#x20;

Where am I?&#x20;

A tiny dark room. Cot in one corner. He isn’t wearing his green pilot jacket, just a soiled undershirt. That’s going to take some explaining to the captain.

He reaches the door. There is no opening device visible. Grimly, he pulls himself up and tries to push. It doesn’t move. He opens the hatch. On the other side is a ship's corridor unlike any he has seen before. The metal is dark and tarnished, with unfamiliar marks etched into it. The lights burn an eye numbing amber color.

Banging on the door results in nothing.

“You entrailgobblers! Open this door by order of the Imperial Guild. I have a ship to pilot!”

Again, nothing.&#x20;

A few more choice expletives deplete his energy reserves. He slumps back down against the door, head in his hands. Tober prides himself on a close shave, but his fingers running over his chin feel several days, maybe a week of growth.&#x20;

A flood of ice-cold terror drenches him. He’s missed the job. Oh no, the pirate. Had he…he shouldn't have…

STOP.

Tober’s sanctimonious, self-aggrandizing anger once again comes to his rescue.

None of this is his fault. It’s that vile bar. Paradise. He’ll explain to the Imperial Guild what happened, they’ll firebomb the deplorable place with everyone in it. He’ll piss on their burning remains. The thought both cheers him and ignites another burning need.&#x20;

Tober stands, undoes his belt and drops his trousers. The Guild will surely rescue a highly-valued pilot like him soon enough. But first, a little present. He relieves himself through the hatch, liberally spraying the corridor and the stacked moldering equipment with urine.&#x20;

His piss short circuits one of the machines, an ancient looking low-tech scanner. The screen illuminates a dull green, a display of information gathered from some previously passing ship glows in the dark.

It is at this exact moment the Emega’ka, the ship Tober Moschick is being held captive on, and the Nocturne ship collide at 550 billion km/sec.&#x20;

Tober standing with his trousers around his ankles is vaporized instantly. His body obliterated along with any hope of a legacy. His name, never to be spoken again.&#x20;
