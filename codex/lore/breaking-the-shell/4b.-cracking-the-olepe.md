# 4b. Cracking the Olepe

“Swayne and I were picked up together. The night we were rescued was a crazy one. IG special forces flew into the trading port on Nitthra. Shut the place down man. Gunfire and explosions raged. At last, they opened the door of the Ai-Lax ship where we were being held as prisoners. Imperial Guild’s finest. Cleaned the place out…they loaded this cargo ship up with everything of value. Ai-Lax ships, random tech, weapons, cases of contraband onosia, raw and processed eonite. You get the idea. Anything of value. They said they would take us back to Pytheas, to resume our mining contracts. The same contracts we were trying to escape from when we were kidnapped. But anything beats sitting in a cell on a Destroyer.”

Tired, sore, and still in shock from the events that afternoon, I stood there listening to the mustached man tell this story almost in a daze. Then one of the others, a large man, spoke up.

“Aye! Will you two stop yapping already. Who really cares where we came from and what our names be. We are stranded. We lost over 10 of our number last night. There’s barely enough rations for us to survive a week here. Could ya please stop with the small talk and work on strategizing?”&#x20;

He wasn’t wrong. We were in bad shape. We lost 9, maybe 10 colonists and the ship's crew when we collided with, whatever it was, while traveling back from Anaxima. We survived in the hull, although we crashed in this unknown place and, to top it off, the bridge was either destroyed or cut off. At any rate, it certainly wasn’t attached anymore.&#x20;

The ship was the Olepe Prime, but beyond that, we didn’t know much else. We’d be locked up ever since we had been “reclaimed” by the Guild.

The guy with the pencil-thin, white mustache spoke again.

“Look, the man asked how Swayne and I knew each other…so I answered the question. I think it would be best if you watched your tone when speaking to me.”

Seemed like they were going to start ripping into each other. They didn't, but it was sure to happen sooner or later.&#x20;

There were four of us here in the large cargo hold. Mr. Mustache, his buddy Swayne, the big guy, and myself. I sat on a makeshift seat, just a bucket flipped over, trying to get a handle on the whole thing. The size of the cargo hold was impressive. I suppose it needed to be to house half a dozen Ai-Lax chariots. The only illumination came from the backup emergency lights. Shadows cast over the majority of the empty space. The real shocker was an Ai-Lax Dreadnought in the center of the room. I’d never seen anything like it. How they managed to acquire one was a complete mystery to me. They were the stuff of legends. But it, and its companions, were also completely useless to us as no one but the Pirates and probably some specially trained Guild operators could fly the things.

On the port side there was a caged off area we hadn’t been able to get open yet, with about 500 containers of unrefined eonite ore strapped to metal pallets. Then another several hundred containers that could only contain pure eon crystals. And to top it off, there was all the onosia. There was a massive amount of wealth being shipped in here.&#x20;

“Ay little buddy, did ya get dem emergency beacons deployed?” asked the large man.

“The beacons already deployed…most likely when the ship crashed. I checked the logs and I'm afraid the transmission was scrambled. If anyone picks our distress call, they won't know where we are. I'll keep working on a secondary alert,” Swayne replied.

The man with the mustache spoke again.

"The way I see it, we have to gather everything on the ship we can find that will help us survive. Six of us are out on the planet looking for signs of life. They should be back soon. So let's split up and pick this ship clean. Meet back here in 30 minutes."&#x20;

I admired his confidence in the face of despair. If it was just me, I would probably go hide somewhere with my stashed bottle of mead and hope it all went away. A little trick of mine, get drunk, pass out, and wake up the next day. Like a time traveler.

Not today though…today I’m going to search this ship and make sure I find something helpful.

The Olepe Prime is surprisingly long, with many corridors full of empty rooms hidden behind closed doors. I went up a small set of stairs that led to the ship's crew quarters. The flood lights barely lit up the hallway, none of the rooms had any lighting. I dumped out my backpack searching for a snap light. This backpack has been with me, even before Pytheas. There was a time when I had everything I could ever need in here. Now it’s just a bunch of junk I've been collecting since that pirate locked me in his ship. I located the light among the pile of random supplies, some wipe paper and my bottle of mead. I thought about opening it up now and having a drink, but with an effort I refrained and packed it back up. &#x20;

I twisted the snap light and the bright white glow from my hand filled the hallway. There were several rooms for the ship’s crew, on each side of the hallway.  I entered the first one on the left. Two double bunks that would sleep four crew members. At the base of each bunk was a foot locker and against the wall were four standing lockers. I discovered a box of dried protein powder at the base of a bunk and stashed it in my backpack. I also found some spare clothing and bedding, but nothing more to eat or drink. The lockers against the wall were all empty except one. It had a photo hanging up of a young woman in flight gear holding a young girl that had to be her daughter. The picture stopped me for a moment as I reflected that the lady in this photograph was likely dead and her daughter would never see her mom again. I lost both parents when I was a child and the pain will creep right back in, if I let it. I slipped the photograph into my backpack.

I closed the locker and exhaled heavily and moved on to the next room, across the hallway.

This room looked identical to the first room, except more used. There were jackets and hats hanging on both bunks and a poster on the wall. "The Nocturne Rangers''...these guys were superheroes to most people. Looked like a bunch of brainwashed soldiers to me.&#x20;

I found some more protein powder and a full canteen. My backpack was feeling more useful than it had in a while. The lockers against the wall were all filled with personal belongings of the crew. I rummage quickly looking for supplies. I nabbed a folding knife out of one and a slightly crushed pack of jabbies out of another. As I was headed back to the hallway I saw something sticking out of a jacket pocket. It was a handwritten letter. The word “Dreadnought” had caught my eye.

I took the letter out and under the glow of the snap light I began to read:

_Sergeant Anders,_

_YOUR EYES ONLY: Strap the Dreadnought over the door after the pickup on Anaxima._

I didn't understand why, but the hair on my arms stood up as soon as I finished reading it.

It was time to meet back up, so I made my way back to the cargo hold.

"Ay fella, have any luck on your search?"

I heard him but didn't answer.

Instead, I grabbed his arm and walked straight for the legendary spacecraft. I got on my hands and knees and started scanning the floor with the snap light looking for any signs of a door. I couldn't see a thing, so I pointed at the ship and made a pushing motion.

He just stared at me confused and slightly upset, “Just tell me what you want, man.”

I pulled down my gaiter for the first time, revealing the two tattooed rings on my neck.

One of the search party just returned, walked towards us and said, “Oi, yer a Sigalian ain’tcha?”

“A what?” the other man responded.

“Sigalian. They all live on some planet out on the edge of the Vi Quadrant. Ancestors had a genetic mutation. Couldn’t speak. Passed it down to all their kids. Those two tattoo bands,” he pointed with a motion, “they all have ‘em. Get marked at birth from what I was told.”

I nodded my head to confirm he was correct.

“So how do they talk?”

“Some hand gesture language, they learn to understand spoken language from offworld speaking teachers and videos.”

I signed, asking him if he could understand me.

“Sorry mate, I don’t know that stuff. Just met some of your kin once or twice.”

So I did what I usually do...point and grunt.

I pointed to one of the straps attached to an eyelet on the floor and grunted.

Eventually I was able to convey that I wanted the Dreadnought moved after I showed them the letter I’d found. Wish I would've thought of that first.

One of the other returned members of the outdoor search party had a tool bag strapped to his waist. He used a pipe wrench to loosen the sleeve on the ratchet chain. One by one, we unstrapped the chains and relieved the pressure holding the pirate craft. We secured the winch and with much pulling and effort managed to move the terrifying ship.

As soon as it was moved, the outline of a trap door became visible through the dirt on the floor. I wiped it away, reached down, and twisted the handle. The latch loudly echoed down the battered hull as the door cracked open.&#x20;

There, in the small compartment below our feet, was a pair of jet-black, hard-sided storage cases. One had glowing symbols that I did not recognize on the top and sides. There was no hasp to open it, nor were there any locks to be seen. The second was similar in appearance, but without the symbols and was accessible, it seemed by a combination lock. Goosebumps ran up my arms as I reached down and pulled the fancy looking boxes out from beneath the floor one-by-one.&#x20;

"What's in there? Come on, open ‘em up."&#x20;

I heard them speaking, but I was in a trance. I could feel the energy of whatever was in these boxes reaching out to me.

"So strange looking. How do you open it?” One of the men looked over the symbol covered box, but seeing no easy method, reached out for the other, “Hey, buddy, let me see if I can get that case open at least."

“Hey, I’ve seen one of those boxes,” another chimed in, “No, not that glowy one, the other. Yeah, it’s what the Guild transports specialized eonite shards in…the uh…oh blast it…amalgam shards they call ‘em.”

I stood up and backed away while my comrades began trying to crack the pair of puzzles. I shook out one of the wrinkled jabbies, lit it, and took a long drag as I sat down on my bucket chair again. The feeling of despair I had experienced earlier today after the crash was gone. I didn’t know how, but I knew that those cases held the answer to how we would get off this planet. In fact I could see beyond that, all the pieces, all the images, connecting, a series rolling through my mind like a film reel in the sun. I closed my eyes and thought, there’s something extra in that jabbie.
