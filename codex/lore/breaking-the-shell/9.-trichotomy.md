# 9. Trichotomy

Between existence and obliteration is the zero moment. Infinitely divisible and instantly gone. A fraction of time when the molecular bonds crack and split, straining to retain a grip on their neighbors; when the selective transport of ions across membranes becomes an unrestricted flood; the DNA replication, half-zipped, becomes helical arms reaching for their companions; the ceramic cup kisses the metal floor and flexes ever so slightly before splintering; the tenuous peace, stretched translucently as the ends pull away from one another, snaps enough strands at their weak centers to ensure fissure is destiny. The zero moment passes. All that was, is shattered.&#x20;

\-------

Jump shock happens when you stop too.

At least this time we’re in fighters, seated. We’ve been told to be ready for action the moment we exit hyperspace. Kee’s in the back running a final systems check for the 4th time.

_1 minute…prepare for jump stop_

Every time I’m about to go into a fight, it’s always the same. Microtremors, imperceptible to anyone but me, run through my nervous system as the chemical dump occurs: adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol. The onosia concentrates are supposed to suppress all responses, level you out and increase focus tenfold. And it does. But it can’t stop the tremors. I’ve learned to be active when they come, press check my sidearm and primary, flip through manuals for procedure, pull out my eonite crystal and twist it in the light. Yellow-blue tinged, it’s about the size of my thumb. Keeon gave it to me when I saved his life some years back, before we were in the Helix. It was some meaningless searchstop we’d run on a junk trader leaving the Omorphia system, completely standard. We boarded to check for stolen goods, we did it 100 times a week. But the guy freaked, and when we got close pulled an ionic razor and whipped the blade at Kee’s neck faster than anyone I’d ever seen. Still, he only managed to slit the jugular about half, because, despite the junker’s speed, I’d seen something was coming. I yanked Keeon back in the same instant I pulled my blaster and blew the man’s head off. Kee’s neck spurt a jet of blood on the wall with every heartbeat until I sealed it with emergenskin, shot him with concentrates to prevent shock, and laid him down while I got a sweep team on the line for backup. Before he let them take him to the trauma center he’d handed me the crystal. Mumbled about how he’d crawled over and pulled it off of, “what was left of the bastard’s neck so that you’ll always remember what you did for me.” I asked him about it later, but he said he was so fazed he barely recalled the fight, much less searching a mangled corpse while half out of his mind. So I’m the only one who remembers. I always keep it on hand and, somehow, I feel sharper, more fully present. Not untouchable…but damn close.&#x20;

I slip the gem back inside my wrist cuff.

_Stop. Stop. Stop._

Three blue strobe pulses tell everyone we’re here.&#x20;

My tremors are gone.

\-------

Hoak’s place didn’t net much. Charred body scars, rubble, a bit of blood. But all the tech, weapons, and remains were gone. Cleaned out by the Guild for analysis and narrative control, surely. But I could still tell roughly what had happened. It did do one thing though. I’m more pissed off than ever.

And now we’re here.&#x20;

I’ve never actually run a mission before. Roy, Arlan, Wade, and especially Scully all look both silly and out of place with weapons strapped on, pockets sagging heavily with protective and emergency gear. I’m sure I look the fool too. In fact, the only one who looks like she belongs in this moment is Moneta. Slim, fit, and sharp-eyed. She wears gear like it’s second nature. I admit to a bit of admiration and jealousy.

“We’re in the sector where the dot changed course in Hoak’s data transmission,” Moneta announces.&#x20;

“Good,” I’m trying to express the calm I know I should feel as leader, “the other VQ ships are, or should shortly be, in the local area. I’m going to need an encoded transmission line up.”

Everyone looks a little surprised, but Wade speaks, “You mean we’re not meeting up?”

“No,” I’m firm, “not now, not ever. We have to retain cell isolation. No matter what.”

“Kyle,” Moneta interjects, “there’s...whoa ok...there’s a lot of traffic in this sector. A Guild cruiser’s already prowling about inspecting the area and I’m picking up a large number of pirate ships exiting hyperspace in the same general vicinity. I don’t think we’re the only ones looking for this crashed freighter.”&#x20;

“It’s fine,” I reply, “We expected the Guild would be here. A few Ai-Lax shouldn’t change things substantially for us. They’ll probably keep each other busy. Just need to stay out of the way and be nimble. Scully, make sure the weapons system is charged and ready. Arlan, keep your hand on the thrusters. If we have to move, we may not have a lot of time.”

“I’m picking up another signal, Kyle,” Moneta says, “It’s emergency beacons. I’d bet they’re from the crashed ship, it’s standard deployment protocol in disasters.”

“But then, why is anyone still looking?” asks Wade.

“Because the data is corrupted or encrypted or scrambled. I don’t know, I’m not entirely sure. But what I’m looking at here doesn’t actually point anywhere real,” she replied.

“Stay on it,” I say, “If anyone can crack it you can. Meanwhile, you all have assignments for now. I’m going to figure out what the other Foreman think about our situation.”

\-------

“Captain…”&#x20;

“Cap-tain…”

“Captain Lo'dak!”

I spin round. Not used to being called “Captain” yet. No slipping. “Shut. Up!” I roar.

Omahk, my tactical officer, shrinks at the outburst.&#x20;

“Well, since you’ve broken my concentration already, you may as well out with it!” I snap. _Power leads_.

“Captain. The Guild cruiser we’re tracking is in the system. Battle is drawing close.”

“Irrelevant. You know the law. Emergencies only.”&#x20;

_The Law of U’rakama Guul: No ship, who’s Captain dies, shall engage in battle for one mooncycle, unless attacked._ I understand it. It is wisdom. It infuriates me.

“Instead of stewing in your pointless agitation, Omahk, be useful,” I continue, “Scan for other ships or try and decode that beacon signal you said you picked up and _breathe for cause_.”

“Yes, Captain.”

So far we have a Guild cruiser, which, according to intel, contains Nocturne fighter ships; a smattering of debris—remnants of the ships that were destroyed here; and some colonist ships that have shown up on the scanners, but are likely either scavenging the wreckage...or preparing to scavenge any new wreckage we create.

“Captain, Guild cruiser is broadcasting.”&#x20;

“On comms.”

_“Ships in the sector. This is now a designated O.Z. until investigations are concluded. Exit the surrounding space from this point to a distance of 12 light years by order of the High Council. You have 10 minutes to comply.”_

“Guild cruiser,” a new voice cut in over the broadcast. It’s flat and cold. “This is Tiljer’mage, Captain of the Nidikori Sa. Ai-Lax do not recognize your designation. Put away the fist you’re shaking, lest we bite it off. You have no authority here, or over us. We do as we please.”

“_9 minutes,”_ was the reply that echoed through every corridor.

Turning to Omahk, I fix his eyes with mine. “You have 9 minutes to find me something, spurl.”

Twenty-five Ai-Lax in the open, ten behind various planets and moons, and me. Thirty-six against a cruiser and an unknown number of Nocturne fighters.

“Captain, I’ve got coded transmissions between several colonist ships in the area. The cryptography is newer, but it’s one we cracked a few weeks ago. That group of colonist rebels, the VQ. Apparently they had a tracker on the ship the Capt…I mean the ship Qal’ret was on. They saw it veer off course suddenly and have taken its speed and flight path to project out a series of potential intercept planets. It seems all but one of the VQ ships are heading that way to check for debris. They’re looking for the package.”

Of course. Because who the hell doesn’t know about the mystery object the Guild had been bringing back at this point…

“Transmit the data to ‘Mage and only ‘Mage. Five minutes remain, we’ll catch the VQ ships if necessary, but I’m not ready to walk away from this fight yet. Stay on transmissions.”

\-------

“_9 minutes”_  the machine-like voice echoes through the hangar.

“Helix,” Kilokan cuts in over previously silent comms, “Ignite.”

Seven Nocturne fighter ships roar their engines. Canopies seal. Shields activate. One after another we zip out the Halelo’s hangar bay, flip weapons hot, and take up ring formation below the cruiser. Simultaneously, the cruiser brings all weapons systems online and the shields raise encapsulating our fighters. We are prepared.

“There will be more Ai-Lax in hiding,” Kilokan’s voice squelches over the comms, “Watch your 6. We have the tactical advantage, but stay tight.”

My HUD displays a scattered series of bracket indicators—locations of pirate craft. The onosia concentrates have my brain ramped up a thousand percent, I’m strategizing potential flight paths, angle of attack, cover fire scenarios. There are nowhere near enough of them to take us on effectively. Either they didn’t plan for us to call the area O.Z. or they have something else in mind.

“Kee. You set?”

“Like a rock, Agony. Let’s smoke some damn Pirates! Yeeoo!”

“Keep it locked down. Something feels off here. Pirates are badly organized, but not stupid and this ratio doesn’t compute.”

“All I see are targets, Ag.”

_I wonder if they’re thinking the same thing._

\-------

“Boom baby!” Moneta’s exclamation is shockingly loud in the quiet.

“You cracked the beacons?” It’s the only thing I can think to ask and I’m excitedly hoping.

“I did. But...but not just the _location_ of the ship…I think I know what happened. That tracker Hoak hid was with the pilot, but the beacons show the ship elsewhere. The whole thing must have split in two. The piece the pilot is in ends up dropping out of hyperspace almost immediately, but the rest of the ship continues on for, like, another couple minutes. It’s almost 20 light years away. In a totally other system!”

“Crush it,” I mumble in shock, “Where to, Moneta?”

She swipes the coordinates from her Nitech to the ship’s nav station.&#x20;

“I have to contact the other VQ ships and let them know what’s going on. I’ll be right back.” I face everyone, “We may still be chasing the short end of the stick, but at least we’re headed to check something no one else is. The rest of you prep for transit. We’re going to that planet to look for the cargo. We don’t know what we’ll find or if there will be survivors or opposition. I want everything we could possibly need at hand.”

In his ready room, Kyle sends the coded messages to the other VQ ships including data on location and beacon analysis. On the bridge, everyone is preparing any remaining gear they may need on arrival at the unknown planet. Everyone except Moneta. Out of the corner of his eye, Wade sees her furiously running through something on her Nitech. When he goes to congratulate her on a job well done she hurriedly finishes the action and folds up the device. Her smile, as she looks into Wade’s eyes, is both luminous and practiced.&#x20;

“Good work, Moneta.”

“Thanks, Wade. Looks like we’ve got something real. Lemme come help with the gear.”

In her pocket, the Nitech buzzes one time to let her know, _Message sent_.

\-------

“Captain Lo'dak,” it’s Omahk again, “There’s another transmission that’s gone through between the VQ ships. I’m working to decrypt now.”&#x20;

“Get it done. Time is up. The cruiser is preparing to fire.”

On the Nidikori Sa, Tiljer’mage turns to his weapons and helm officers. “Evasive maneuvers, activate decoy probes, lock weapons on the main cruiser cannons and fire at will!”

\-------

Even though I can’t see the particle cannons on the ship’s deck, I swear I can feel them. Blue plasma arcing across surfaces as the outer casing slides back, simultaneous counter-balancing to defend against recoil, flaming charge rages inside the barrel, and the slamming home of the casing releases the icy, drop-shaped shot across space. Our cockpit shadows shift with the intense glow as the twenty-five azure charges streak away toward twenty-five pirate craft at terrifying speed.&#x20;

I know it takes ten seconds to recharge cannons.&#x20;

I know there are five additional cannons prepared to track any newly appearing ships.&#x20;

I know the deck has three other primary weapon systems on board.&#x20;

But my grip tightens.

“Uh…Ag…man are you seeing this?!”

“I see, I see. What the hell...”

“Did those ships just jump from hyperspace?”

Each green bracket divides into five green brackets—flowers bursting open everywhere.&#x20;

“No Kee man, it’s like they multiplied!”

Scanners now say well over one hundred Ai-Lax ships. Suddenly they break erratically from one another; movement completely incomprehensible, it’s all swooping, cutting paths.&#x20;

The cruiser’s energy charges explode destroying ten ships caught in the blast radius, but eighteen brackets disappear.

“General,” I rapidly call over comms, “General, they’ve got a kind of decoy holographic projector. They must be mimicking the appearance and energy signatures of the pirate craft that launched them. When we hit a ship, its probes go offline.”

“Given you a direct line to the Halelo,” replied Kilokan, “Repeat that.”

I relay the information again.

The cruiser’s railguns immediately open up. Fully-automatic fire sends thousands of projectiles hurtling through the cosmos at 10,000 meters a second; silver sweeping streaks in the blackness.

The pirate craft have closed so much distance now that particle cannons are useless. Focused laser guns are online, but they do minimal damage against energy shielding of the Ai-Lax. Probes are dropping out of existence as they’re hit. Everything a mass of confused energy, projectiles, shield deflections. But I see it all in patterns. Numbers and brackets rapidly disappear. Seventy-five. Sixty. Forty. Explosions in all places. Not just probes, it’s some of the Ai-Lax too.&#x20;

We’re about to dogfight. Helix ships are still within the protective canopy of the Halelo, but the enemy is almost on us.

“All Helix,” the eternal calm of General Kilokan reigns, “move to intercept, let’s clean up. Halelo command, cover us. We’re going hunting.”

When he’s speaking I see a glint. The probes aren’t dead, they’re being pulled in, but no displayed energy signatures. Speeding up. Magnetic...gravitational. Like...they’re bombs!

I yell into comms, “Belay that! Halelo! Shields to max!”

Automatic impact defensive systems picked up on them at the last second. Laser fire fills the deadly vacuum with violent red beams, explosion after explosion. But I see explosions rock the cruiser as well.

Ship’s computer voice, _“Impact. Impact. Halelo has taken hits. Tactical systems damage minimal. FTL Propulsion offline.”_

Then a real voice, somehow calm and even, “Helix ships remain nested at your current position below the hull for 5 seconds. Emergency defensive countermeasures coming online.”&#x20;

Chaos laser fire, more than I thought ever possible, suddenly erupts in all directions. Detonations are limited but effective.

“All remaining bomb decoy probes destroyed,” it’s the Halelo again, “and all enemy ships and probes are now radar locked in your systems whether powered or not. We’ll be eliminating any when shots are clear. Happy hunting, Helix.”

Dog fight on. I slam the thruster.

\-------

“I have the location the VQ ship is headed, Captain. They decoded the emergency beacons of the Olepe Prime and believe a significant portion of the ship has crashed there.”

“Helm!” I snap. “Get us to Omahk’s decoded coordinates. Full speed. And give me shipwide comms. ‘This is Lo'dak, prepare to wet your blades. We go for plunder. Captain out.’”&#x20;

“Captain. We can jump in five minutes.”

“We jump in two. Inform the Nidikori Sa, I will not be presumed a coward for leaving.”

I watch, for two minutes, in thirstful agitation as countless decoy probes and more than a few Chariots vaporize beneath the firepower of the Guild and I curse the mother of U’rakama Guul.&#x20;

I take my chair.

We disappear in hyperspace.

\-------

The fight is not easy. Ai-Lax Chariots are powerful and well-armored, and these pirates are especially skilled. But our ships are agile and fast in ways they cannot compete against. They rely on deviousness, we have rigor.&#x20;

“Kee, there are three probes in quadrant 22, I need tensor charges launched, set delay fuse nine seconds.”

“Calculating trajectory, and spooling...I need five degrees starboard rotation.”

“You’ll have it, gotta cut around behind the Destroyer, drop an antimatter warhead up his port hole.”

“Hold your angle...charges away!”&#x20;

The Destroyer implodes all plasma and destruction. We receive several shots to the aft shields before the dropped probes pop—gargantuan fireballs leaving debris and smoke that obscure our evasive maneuvers. The rest of the Helix are having equal success.&#x20;

Navcomm voice, _“Ai-Lax reinforcements arrived.”_

My screen repopulates in green brackets, which immediately unfold their released probes.

“Let’s go, Agony. Grind em up man!” I hear Kee grinning through the headset.

Almost immediately the Halelo lashes out against the distant probes and pirate ships. But they learn fast and close the distance to us quickly.

“Lykal and Rotel! Stagger formation, Lykal my port side. We’ll corkscrew, drag and drop, then driver-move. Set in 3...Go!”

Our three fighters slice through a group of pirates too closely clustered. We punch their middle firing at aft shields, and in the chatter leave a set of mines in our wake, then throttle away at full speed. The concussion of attacks both in front and behind result in massive debilitation to their shields. The Halelo cleans up with two powerful, well-placed shots.

“Yeah, Agony!” Lykal hollers.

Rotel follows suit, “Clean maneuver, Agony! Let’s go.”

“More out there,” I reply, “Keep moving.”

“Ranger Agonis,” the General, “Private comms.”

I switch, “Sir.”

“Agonis, I have word directly from the High Council. Package location intel. You, Keeon, and I will make double-time there immediately. Transmitting coordinates now. Break from the fight and jump.”

“Yessir, but the rest of the Edge sir?”

“They’re the best, Agonis. They’ll be fine. The call of the Council supersedes our lives.”

“Sir.” I cut out the conflict immediately, but not before lobbing a last bomb at a foundering pirate.

“Helix, this is General Kilokan. Ranger Agonis, Keeon, and I have Council break away orders. You soldiers have the field. Halelo, watch my men.” Then his voice dropped an octave, “Nocturne. Erase them.”

We jump.

\-------

“Readings indicate acceptable surface conditions,” Wade says looking over the scans, “Oxygen is low, but breathable. Some tectonic instability, so we should try and make it as short a trip as possible.”

“Gear up,” I say, “Be equally ready to use medical packs and weapons. We don’t know what’s going on down there.”

At the end of a massive trough gouged in the surface, somehow still in a single piece, is the upright hull of the Olepe Prime. The surface of the planet rotates rapidly towards darkness. We need to get down and make contact while there’s still light.

We set down near, but not next to the vessel and exit, weapons ready, if a bit unsteady.

“Who is it?!” Someone yells from the dust.

“We’re VQ.” Wade yells back, then realizing they might not understand, “We’re colonists, here to rescue you!”

“You’re not Guild?”

“Definitely not,” I reply. “But we need to get you out of here before the Guild realizes we’ve found you.”

“Aye,” it’s another voice, “but we’ve got some things to collect before we’ll be leavin’.”

“Well, make it quick,” I say.

“Lad, you should see what we got here.”

They must have the object. “What is it?” I ask walking forward. The dust is finally settling and we’re face to face with a small collection of castaway colonists. Shake hands all around.

“A full set of pirate ships,” says the first voice waving us into the hull, “eonite, onosia, and a couple cases. We’ve only gotten one open though. There’s the other one,” he points, “we can’t figure out what it is.”&#x20;

I lift the case, examine it. I’ve never seen anything like it. But it radiates energy and I know.

Moneta is suddenly by my side. “Do you want me to take a look?” she offers eagerly. “You know, see if I can crack it?”

“No. It’s fine. I’ve got it.”

My mind whirs. With pirate ships the VQ would...well, the possibilities were far reaching.

“Alright,” I yell out. “Let’s start with the cargo, get everyone moving everything they can into our ship as quick as they can before...”

An Ai-Lax pirate ship booms into the airspace and swoops down a moderate distance from the opened hangar bay of the hull.

“Everyone take cover!” I yell, and signal to Wade and the rest to pull out weapons.

“There’s nowhere for you to run,” a black voice bellows from the Kakain Chariot, “We’re coming out. Don’t bother shooting. We’re far more well-armed than you and one of my weapons officers has a lock on your group.” The massive undermounted cannon swivels its barrel at us while the ship’s bay door opens. A sizable number of pirates swagger out.

“Well, what a pretty picture we have here,” the lead man says, must be captain, “It seems I’ll be taking on a fine collection of servants and goods.” He eyes me, “Give me the package.”

“What package?”

A sinister smile, “There is only one package worthy of note. Me and the crew will be taking all you’ve got.”

The group of pirates advance sinisterly, guns drawn.&#x20;

We and the castaways rapidly retreat further into the hull, nesting behind anything we can.

I hear the captain’s laughter echoing after me, “Hahaha...We’ll just blow up your ship then. Kill you all. One. By. One.” He punctuated each syllable with a blaster shot.

For a moment, time stops. Everything seems in play. The sun slips down on the horizon’s edge, the dust kicked up from the pirate craft sideslips the space between our two groups. I can see directly down the blackness of the cannon aimed at my head, feel the energy pulsing from the case, hear the labored breathing of Scully, watch the slow arc of the pirate captain’s blaster raising again, and I realize I am at the edge of death. I can see all the machinations interlacing through spacetime, the VQ and colonists and pirates and the pieces of the Guild, all swarming around Pytheas, all crashing into each other like atoms. Smashing. Releasing energy. Exploding.

A cry bursts from the pirate craft “Captaaaain!” and is cut off as the entire ship and all the earth under it explode like a bomb detonated inside. The concussion throws everyone to the ground. Two Nocturne fighters blaze in low past the smoldering wreckage and land either side of the crater they just blew open. “Colonists,” they announce, “We are Nocturne, servants of the Guild. If there are Ai-Lax aboard that wreck, your only hope of mercy is to surrender immediately and unconditionally. You have two minutes.”

The pirates find their feet and rush the hangar. The Captain grabs Arlan and puts the weapon to his head. “Looks like you’re all leverage now.”&#x20;

“Why would you hold us hostage?” Wade asks fervently, “We want them dead too.”

Perplexed, the pirate lead says, “You’re colonists.” It’s almost a question.

“We’re more than that. We’re VQ. The underground. We fight the Guild.”

I see him thinking. His eyes seem to adjust to the dimly lit interior. Suddenly, he sees the Dreadnought. For a moment he forgets himself, passes Arlan to his mate and walks to the ship, runs his hand over its skin. “_My ship is my mind_,” he mutters, “Impossible that one could be here.”&#x20;

He suddenly shoves out his hand and smiles, “Captain Lo'dak.” In shock, I shake tentatively. “Make you a deal,” he continues with instant good humor, “Seeing as how I no longer have a ship, we fight together and survive. I take these ships, and an equal portion of the goods.”&#x20;

“I keep the people and the cases,” I reply snappily.

For a moment Lo'dak ponders. Historic ship of lore, more powerful than nearly all other pirate craft known, or bothersome slaves and a Guild relic of indefinite purpose the entire galaxy seeks to obtain as a means of controlling the future...

“Done.” He turns and yells to everyone, “Bring out your weapons. Align barricades. You! Castaways! Take these blasters. Prepare to fight.”

I pull Wade aside and hand him the case. I try to keep as low a whisper as possible, “Try to get out through that hole in the other end of the hull and get aboard the ship. Whatever’s in here...it seems more important than anything else. Don’t let anyone see you.”

“I’m not leaving this fight.”

I look him in the eyes, “Don’t you feel it Wade? This...thing…this is it. The cargo everyone is after. If we don’t make it you need to run the autopilot and get it to the VQ. My authority reverts to you should anything happen. You’re ready. Now go.”

His face sets hard with understanding and frustration and he begins moving as stealthily as possible to the rear of the remains of the Olepe.

Everyone else gathers at the gaping aperture of the hull and takes cover.&#x20;

The next second, the Nocturne soldiers exit their ships with practiced agility, and the pirates open up on them. But their aim is bad at distance and each of the three soldiers has their rifle locked in tight, their bodies turned on angle. One pirate drops and a colonist cries out in pain.

“Drop your weapons,” the largest soldier yells out, “Colonists, we will return you to Pytheas. Pirates you will be treated fairly as prisoners.”&#x20;

More blaster fire from the pirates.

The Nocturne get cover behind large grey stones. But I see only two.

Lo’dak calls out, “Keep your eyes. One of them will have taken up a high ground position, don’t overexpose.”

In that moment, a pirate spasms and drops beside Kyle, his head a sopping pink donut. One Nocturne behind the rocks opens up fire and begins advancing to a closer stone. A castaway puts a few shots down range, but he’s leaned out too far and his arm vaporizes in mist.&#x20;

The pirate captain pulls out a bomb of some kind and calls to the rest of us. “I caught the glint from the overwatch. He’s on top of one of the fighters.” He fits the bomb into the muzzle of his blaster. “All of you, when I say ‘fire’ open up. Shoot everywhere. I need distraction.” Calls of ready all around. “Fire!”

Dozens of us all begin wildly shooting at once. Total pandemonium—laser blasts and projectiles ricocheting off the rocks and Nocturne fighter ship shields and lighting up the air and in the midst of it the pirate captain takes aim and fires the shell. It arcs well over the heads of the two soldiers behind the boulders landing ineffectually at the foot of one of their ships.&#x20;

We continue shooting another few seconds until he calls for cease fire.&#x20;

“It didn’t do anything!” I call over.

Then he turns and smiles a sinister, calculated smile, and knowingly sticks his head out.

“NO!” I yell.

_KA-KOOOOOOOM!!!_

The Nocturne fighter explodes in a massive green fireball, illuminating the night.

Flaming shrapnel cascades from the sky igniting dry grasses and scrub bush, anything combustible. The ship is gone. The world is on fire.

\-------

My fighter is a burning slag heap. General Kilokan and I were both blown into our shielding rocks by the concussion. Kilokan’s missing half a leg, the fingers of his left hand, and has a large metal fragment sticking out of his chest. His breathing is labored yet slow, training prevents him from hyperventilating, but his blood is exiting rapidly and he can’t reach around the shard to tie off the leg. “Agonis,” cough, “Need a hand here.”

My ears ring from the concussion, my head swims. I’m trying to reestablish bearings. I blind fire over the stone, back towards the pirates and colonists. It doesn’t matter if I hit, I need time to recover and assess. Wild blasts make confusion and I need them to question how many of us are left alive. I slap the comms transmitter at my neck “Ranger Agonis, code 2620, Helix subunit under fire, need backup immediately, multiple enemies, Pirates, Colonists, repeat code 2620, center my location.” I feel around, but my med kit ripped off my tactical belt. Emergency concentrates in my right shoulder pouch. But my reaching doesn’t do anything. I see a hole near my left shoulder and wetness. The tacvest stopped most shrapnel, but one fragment cut in; it’s impeding muscle fiber movement. Two choices: drop gun, pull it, hope to regain function enough to get the concentrates before I bleed out, or keep some tactical capability, move to Kilokan, and we try to help each other. Round check, damn I’m low. Rapid, staggered mag dump so they can’t tell I’m out, one-handed reload, the blaster between my knees, and pop off a few more shots. Quickly scutter to the General’s position, I’m trying to stay low and not trip over the flaming scrap everywhere. Kee...no...I shake him out of my head. Not now. I made it. A few more wild shots into the atmosphere.&#x20;

“General.” He’s fading. I swat him hard across the face. He’s out of it for a second. “I need my left arm to tie your tourniquet, you have to pull my shrapnel after you get my concentrates from my right shoulder pocket.” He’s bad, lot of blood out, but if we move quick he can make it. His right hand shakes from the effort, he pulls my concentrates, puts them in my hand, I lean down and he grabs the shard at my shoulder. “Two...three!” I lean out while he pulls but his fingers slip. I fall back and Kilokan’s hand drops. “Ag,” barely a whisper, he licks dust coated lips, words choking, “...ake the bl...thuh...lu...cup...”&#x20;

His eyes go dead.

I’m alone.&#x20;

Flash in the sky. They must be shooting again. No choice now. Snag the concentrates packet up from the ground, rip it open with my teeth. I’ll eat half then stuff the rest in my shoulder after I pull the shard out. Onosia paste should keep me from passing out. I fire a round of shots over the rock, I hear another weapon firing but nothing hits close by. Drop my pistol, bite half the green chunk, and grip the shrapnel as tightly as I can. My body vibrates. Here we go, here we go, here we...a black-gloved hand, powerful and firm suddenly snaps onto mine, preventing me from pulling.&#x20;

“If you do that you’ll bleed badly, and I need you effective, Ranger Agonis.”

\-------

“We got one at least, maybe two,” yells Lo'dak over the projectiles ringing off the hull, “Keep cover.”

“Aaagghhh!” One of the pirates is hit in the leg.&#x20;

“Get a med kit on that wound and stay low,” I holler to Arlan, then turn to the lead pirate, “What now?”

“We wait for a break in the fire. He’ll have to reload eventually.”

“Can’t you shoot another of those grenade-bombs?”

“Haha! No. Neither cheap nor easy to come by.”

“What was it? How did it get through the shields?”

“Detonak, fully programmable. I set to trigger when it sensed the shields drop. The Nocturne shooter on the roof of the fighter had synchronized the shields to his rifle. Each time he fired, the shields dropped for a split second to allow passage of the round, otherwise the shots would just deflect back at him. Tune the Detonak to register the signature, when the shield clicks off, the boom clicks on. Goodbye, Nocturne.” And Lo'dak smiled that slow, terrible smile again. His efficiency was terrible to witness.

“Alright. But, again, what now?”

“Give it a minute or two, we may have wounded them bad enough they won’t last. Next break in the shooting we advance, try to take down any remaining. Permanently.”

More ricochets, someone’s hit in the bicep, another nearly takes one to the head, but it just clips his ear.&#x20;

Sudden and brilliant light streaks across the sky lighting up everything and projectiles begin raining down on us from above with a high degree of accuracy. Two pirates collapse—one hit through the leg, another through the abdomen. Then white, blinding flares illuminate the whole area like it’s day again.

“Back!” Lo'dak yells, “Get back, get low.”

“What is that?!”

“Reinforcements, gahh,” a shot grazes his neck, “but it’s only one ship and it’s arrived too fast. We should have had more time.”&#x20;

“Well? What the hell do we do now?!”

“Reload.”

\-------

“General Kilo...”

“He’s gone. As is, I’m afraid, Ranger Keeon. Now spit out that concentrate. I need you to eat this, it’s stronger and fresh.”&#x20;

“Are you...a Halogen? I don’t know you.”

“Halogen Selaht. Now eat.”

The concentrate is lightning in my bones. Pain melts, I become clear, I can see all. “Good. I can see it takes effect. Now listen carefully. I’m going to remove your shrapnel. You’ll put these concentrates in the hole. And you will need your sidearm...” The Halogen’s hand hovers near mine for a moment while reaching across. “What...is in that wrist pouch?”

“A crystal.”

He excises the stone and looks through it. “Fascinating. Discard those concentrates. This will suffice. I remove the shrapnel, you place that in the wound instead.”

“What?”

“Trust me soldier...ready?”

With a smooth and powerful pull the metal slides free and blood immediately follows, but I’m so ramped up by the stuff I was given I feel the sensation only in the most distant way. I jam the crystal into the wound, pushing it through the blood and cloth fibers and suddenly my mind jumps another ten levels. For a moment I’m scared my brain might actually blow out. Then in a few seconds it comes under control. The blood and flesh coagulate at high speed. I can actually feel my muscles knit together, encapsulating the gem inside my body. I am whole in moments. But the work isn’t ended, the energy radiates outward through every system, aches and stiffness absorbed into it, washed away, I feel beyond anything I’ve ever known.&#x20;

The Halogen smiles, “Where did you get that crystal?”

“It was a gift.”

“That it was. Now, Ranger.”

“Yes, Halogen Selaht.”

“I need cover fire on the 1st and 3rd quadrants at my mark.”

“Yes, Halogen.”

“Take this. Drink it if you need it. Though with that embedded crystal, I doubt you will.”

With that, he’s gone like a mist. I struggle to keep the image in my head. His masked face, large eyes were terrifying. His cloak and hood not quite black, or grey, but somehow both and also mimicked or reflected the surroundings. Even with my mind amped up everything about him is hard to see and remember.

I collect Kilokan’s rifle and ammunition, his stun grenades, everything else of use. Keeon’s dead. I normally would be raging. But this anger is different. Never felt anything so deep, incomprehensibly cold. It’s a cosmic void opened inside my soul filled with nothing but pure, calculated, and patient loathing. In that moment I knew, if I had to, I would wait a hundred years for the right opportunity to annihilate them all.

“Ranger,” Halogen Selaht on my comms, “on my mark open fire, but be prepared to cease engagement any instant.”

“Yes, Halogen.”

A last moment of peace as I await his command.

“Now.”

I pull pin, lob the first concussion grenade, and strafe out shooting.&#x20;

It feels effortless.

\-------

“Grenade!”&#x20;

Everything goes blinding white. I’m dying.

...

“KYLE!”&#x20;

I come to with a start. Someone calling my name. Must have only been out for an instant. Feels like someone hit my head with a hammer. Shots ring out, more ricochets around the hangar. Another explosive goes off at the back knocking me on my ass again. Everything’s happening all around us, we can’t retreat, we can’t advance.

“WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!” I know I’m yelling, but I can’t hear my own volume.

Then suddenly the destruction cuts off.

A voice that sounds like rushing water thunders from outside. “Pirates and Colonists. I have your companion. There is an item I need. Bring it or she dies.”

“She?” I look around for Moneta, but she’s gone.&#x20;

“Kyle!”&#x20;

It’s her, I know her voice. I stand without thinking and I am looking directly on a Halogen for the first time. Cloaked and hooded, his face hides behind a fearsome filtration mask. The vision portals are owl eyes, deep and dark. He holds a red luminous blade below her chin.

“What do you want?”&#x20;

“The case.” He speaks easily, like we’re having coffee. “That strange one you haven’t been able to open. Though you tried. It doesn’t belong to you. Call that companion you gave it to. Get him out of the shadows. I’ve no inclination to exterminate every one of you to find it. It would be such a waste of time.”

“No.” Now he’s speaking under his breath, not to me. “Don’t shoot him.” Then at normal volume again, “Nevermind. It seems your companion has returned. Please step out here.” He’s speaking to the void of night, “My Nocturne has a bead directly on you. If you run he’ll have no choice but to take your life.”

Wade walks out, case in one hand, the other buried in his pocket. “Go ahead, kill her. I know already. You think I care about dying?” I’ve never seen him so angry. He pulls his hand out of his pocket and I can see it holds an unpinned grenade which he tosses at the Halogen’s feet casually.&#x20;

The cloaked figure blurs through the distance with a speed I’ve never known was possible. As I duck I see Moneta tumbling towards the hangar and screaming and the Halogen suddenly crouched on top of Wade.&#x20;

The grenade detonates and fragments slam on every surface. I’m back up a moment after and Moneta is squeezing her thigh in pain. The Halogen, swarmed over Wade like a lion, yanks him to his feet. But he doesn’t seem to see the blaster in Wade’s hand.

“Now...” Wade yells, shoving the gun under the Halogen’s chin and grinning triumphantly. “We need to get a few things straight.”

“Perhaps. But if you don’t remove that weapon and hand me the case, you’ll never see it happen.”

“Tell me how to open the case.”

“Why would you do this?” He sounds genuinely interested, “The Nocturne soldiers you’ve killed were sent to collect that case and save everyone stranded here. And yet you threaten to kill a member of the High Council.”

“Because we’re the VERT QUARRY! We want you dead!”

“I know who you are. Children tearing down what you did not build. How quickly you forget what was offered to you, what opportunities were opened. The Guild rained down beneficence upon you, gave you freedom and means to succeed, prosper even, and your only reply is that it isn’t enough? We did not need to open the gates of Pytheas to the galaxy.”

“Don’t act high and mighty,” Wade pushes the gun in harder, “like you don’t benefit. It wasn’t altruism.”

“No. But neither was it parasitism. It was to be a relationship of symbiosis. And it shall be, despite the paltry tantrums. You will never take control of Pytheas. You will not prevent the next stage of development. You only ensure your own annihilation. The Guild will seek every vestige of the cancer you represent and carve the VQ from the body politic.” Suddenly the Halogen is standing behind Wade. The case is now in his hand, as is that luminous red sword. I hadn’t seen him move and it takes me a moment to realize what happened. He turns slightly and speaks in a low tone that carries in the sudden stillness. “Consider yourselves hunted.”

And Wade, from the chest up, slides off of Wade’s bottom half, crumpling into a heap of flesh.

“NO! WADE NO!” I madly shoot and shoot and shoot but they’re both gone. Wade dead and the Halogen disappeared in another blur of movement I can’t follow. The two remaining Guild ships suddenly fire up and vanish into the atmosphere in a flash.

I run to Wade’s corpse. Nothing is left of the man but his shell.&#x20;

I turn to Lo’dak. “What now? Do we run? Will there be more?” I’m verging on hysteria.

“No. They got what they came for. We have time. Bury your friend. We’ll split the cargo. Kyle, come here.”

He pulls me to the side.&#x20;

“Something’s changing,” he whispers. “I propose an arrangement. You and I, we make a deal. Intel and action cooperation. You give me the inside track on what you learn on the Colonist and VQ side of things, I share Ai-Lax information, and if situations arise that need some doing, we work together.”

“I...I don’t know.”

“Listen, nothing like this has ever been done. But after tonight...let’s just say I’m looking at all possible options. Try it as a test. Get uncomfortable, we cut ties.”

“Yeah. I mean.” I can’t think, but how can I lose? “Deal. Now, I...I gotta go...”

“I’m gonna load up and get out of here. Get out your Nitech. This is my private encoded channel key. Don’t lose it.”

He airpasses the key to my device.&#x20;

“Go bury your man.”

The Pirate crew works quickly breaking open the cages to remove the rEON and EON. They detach and load their new chariots, manning each with the minimum crew, Lo'dak takes the Dreadnought, and with all possible haste they’re gone too.&#x20;

In the meantime, we bandage the wounded and dig a grave for Wade. One of the castaways brings a section of the destroyed Nocturne fighter to serve as a headstone. I scribe it, “Wade Thysia, Loyal Friend, Selfless, Stolid, Sacrificial”.

The edge slices my palms when I shove it into the earth, but I don’t feel it. I just see the red and press my hands onto the etched face of the silver metal. I whisper “From the darkness into light.”

“Let’s load it up, people.” I stand and yell. “I want to take off in an hour. Godforsaken hellscape belongs in my wake.”

I check on the remaining VertQuarry crew, Roy’s shaken but suffered nothing worse than some scuffing, Arlan is getting tiny metal shards pulled from his face and neck and took a shot through the upper bicep but he’s essentially fine. Scully, unbelievably, is completely unscathed.&#x20;

I look for Moneta. She’s in a corner nursing her bandaged thigh and looking particularly dumbstruck.&#x20;

“Hey.” I say.

“Hey.”

“How you holding up?”

“Ok. I just can’t believe Wade’s gone.”

“I’m going to deal with that in due course.” I speak softly, but my internal rage is an exploding bomb in my fist. “Moneta, why was Wade ready to see you die? You two were...?”

“He felt that way. But I told him there was someone else.” Her eyes flick to my face for a moment—a butterfly’s wing beat.

I smile, “Get on the ship soon, ok.”

Something though...behind the look. A lie is woven in somewhere.

\-------

In the hangar, I follow Halogen Selaht to an alcove. Still tuned up, but it’s different than onosia effects. Feeling permanent.

“Yes, Ranger Agonis,” He answers my thoughts, “you feel the crystal. So long as it resides within your body you feel the heightening. You will adapt in time. But not immediately.” He sighs. “Losing Kilokan is a significant blow to our work. I am aware of your service record and have authority to promote. Therefore, congratulations, General, you will now lead the Nocturne.”

“What of Pirates...the battle? I need to get out, fight with the other Helix.”

“The battle concludes. Many Ai-Lax were eliminated, one Helix craft crippled, two damaged. No casualties. Once the item was recovered I ordered an end to the offensive. Your soldiers enter the hangar as we speak.” He waves an arm out and fighters are entering. “Understand Agnois, macro level relations must change. Continued functionality of the system requires seismic shifts in politics.”

“Halogen?”

“Yes?”

The hatred I feel is a chasm, “I must destroy them...the pirates, VQ...they...”

“In time. First comes ceasefire. We establish overt peace. Revenge has a day, but this is not it. Remember General, a warrior’s keenest blade is patience.”

“Yes, Halogen.”

The look he gives burrows into me though it’s behind the deep wells of a mask, “As long as it takes, Agonis. Remain prepared.”

I turn, nearly leaving, but...Kilokan dead, Keeon dead, Rehawk, Bowcom, Sodek, Romcik, the death, I must ask, “What was this all about? You left everything but the case. What can equal the value?”

“In this case is everything we seek...have been seeking. Key. Piece of a key. Fragment of a shadow. An answer to the longing, stifled and gasping, beneath the collapsed rubble in each soul of the galaxy.” He swipes his palm across the surface speaking a series of unintelligible, jumbled words over it, internal clasps release and a seam appears where none had been. “Touch the surface...” he opens the case like a clamshell, “...just for a moment.”

Within, nested in foam, the muted grey metallic triangle glints in the white light, angled markings scribed across its surface. I reach to rest my hand on it.&#x20;

I’m gone from this body moving at infinite speed no thought or sight only knowledgebeingsound...

_Sarcopolis. (some)_

_Trikandia. (thumping)_

_Flung spires aglow in darkness. (deep rhythmic drum)_

_Purified plains of erupted, arboreal constellations. (drum beats closer)_

_Luminous fires of hope, translation. Inseparable then shattered tapestry of life. (too close it’s everything)_

_Fueled to crack wide transmissions to eternity’s gate replay non-stop within the last extremity of being. (too strong, filled my mind)_

_New known galactic free kingdoms veil immolated. (consumed, no, i’m lost)_

“kuuuuhhhh-aaaaaa” I’m back, on one knee, drawing breath like I never breathed. “Wha...what the...what just?”

“Yes, General.” His voice resonates, he reseals the shell, “That was the barest experience. Nothing known comes near. We cracked the doorway of discovery. Beyond all imagination we seize the other side. Nothing can stop us. Our work has barely begun. Concentrate forces. Rebuild the Helix Edge. Your next assignment is closer than you are prepared for. Rise. And command.”

_Epilogue_

In her dreams Flight-Lieutenant Katrina Marshall drinks endless wine from golden goblets, eats freshly picked jungung fruit and sits beside a fountain, mist cooling her skin under a lightly clouded sun.&#x20;

A sharp noise snaps her awake. She grabs for her blaster, prepared to kill some wild beast. They had been scavenging the wreckage, the scent of the mangled, decaying pirate still permeating the air.&#x20;

She slips on her air mask and pokes a head out of the room she’s taken up residence in. And nearly drops the gun.

A group of colonists turns at the noise, looks her over for a moment, and one steps forward.

“You need a ride, ma’am?”

\*_The Law of U’rakama Guul - one of the laws put in place by early pirates to govern Ai-Lax behavior. It intends to prevent reckless or emotional newly-ascended Captains from wasting life and resources prior to accustoming themselves to their new positions and the reality that there is no longer an officer immediately supervising them. It may be broken in emergencies._

_\* “Power leads.” - The first half of a central, ancient Ai-Laxian proverb relating to the inescapable, intertwined nature of the two elements. The remainder of the proverb is “Weakness dies.”_

_\* “Breathe for cause.” - yet another proverb. This one paraphrased from the original “Breathe and die for cause.”_

_\* O.Z. - Occupied Zone, a claim unique to the Guild which they insist, for purposes of operational safety, allows them to confiscate entire regions of space and to remove anyone present and reroute travel around the area. It is a self-appointed power._

\* ”_My ship is my mind, I wage war through its reach.” - Said to be the mantra of the first Pirate to fly a Dreadnought class ship._
