# 5b. The Ascension

For nearly a week Hoak has stared at the green dot. Watching its journey unfold: travel out, stop at (he supposed) Anaxima, and now traveling back. Riveted, he's barely been able to move away from his screen. The big reveal is coming. Suddenly the dot began veering off course. Hoak leaned forward, literally on the edge of his seat and then….Nothing.&#x20;

Staring at the screen in confusion, Hoak rubs his eyes. The dot’s gone. Ok. Keep cool. It’ll be back. He sits and waits. More nothing. He’s suddenly, acutely aware of a dull ache in his head and the stifling heat. What am I doing? Sleep. I need sleep. Probably just a little interference and when I wake up the precious green dot will be back. He lies down in his bunk. Closes his eyes. But, right there in the darkness burnt into the centre of his consciousness is the green dot gleaming. Taunting him. He opens his eyes. No dot. Closes, dot. Opens, no dot. Closes, dot. Open, close, open, close...Then the old but all too familiar feeling of suffocating helplessness starts to rise up like acid in his throat.&#x20;

“Enough,” he shouts. The cavernous mine speaks the word back, reprimanding him. Stop lying around. This is slipping through his fingers. He knows better. Do the work. Get some answers.&#x20;

Hoak was raised in a munitions factory run by his raging tyrant of a father who used his 7 sons as indentured servants. His insidious meanness poisoned the boys more than the noxious gases that turned their eyeballs yellow. Most of the brothers got mad; like daddy. Little identikit narcissists beating down anyone weaker, trying to rid themselves of the helpless hopelessness. But Hoak found a different defense. Hoak got sneaky. He got smart. He spied, learned, hid, collected, prepped and planned until he escaped to Pytheas.&#x20;

The defenses once fundamental to survival are not easily surrendered. On Pytheas he quickly found himself slipping back into his old ways. Dear old daddy might not be there but there was a new tyrannical authority in his life: the Imperial Guild. They had things he coveted. They displayed power and privilege. So inch by inch he slipped back into old habits. He hadn’t meant it to go this far. But, it was all he knew.&#x20;

What had started off as a little sly intel and prep—a few radio interceptors and a couple of rail guns buried underground—had somehow expanded into a fully equipped war room built into a side chamber of his mine.&#x20;

Hoak walks to a bank of radio interceptors that automatically scan the air waves for IG transmissions. Why is nothing coming through? Don’t trust automatic. Do it yourself. Do the work, Hoak. He flicks it to manual and starts sweeping the air waves. His hand on the switch, the static in his ear and the red dust slowly floating in the air. Time hangs. Flow state. Endless.&#x20;

Then something.&#x20;

_Emergency transmission level 9, Emergency transmission level 9. Imperial Guild cargo ship damaged in transit. Cargo, essential recovery. All Guild ships in sectors 17-39 are immediately seconded to form a search party. Tune to channel 38 to receive your personal search coordinates. This is commanded by the highest order of the Imperial Guard. Emergency transmission level 9, Emergency transmission level 9…_

Hoak lets his hand drop from the dial and sits back. The ship has gone down. The cargo lost. The Guild have no idea where it is. He had just as good a chance of finding it as they did. Better probably. He suddenly remembered the supplementary readout he’d dismissed. As good a place to start as any. He’d do the work. Whatever it takes.&#x20;

Time to go. Flat run to the entrance of the main mine. Wait, stop. Don’t lose your head. Remember the protocol.&#x20;

He opens a locked cabinet with a key on his belt and pulls out a box. Pops it open. Inside is a thin metal band he attaches to his left wrist. He presses his right thumb into a small embedded scanner. The whole bracelet lights up green. Stays like that for 10 seconds and then settles into a steady, pulsing flash.&#x20;

Ok what's next? Hoak turns to his shelves. What does he…..

_EEEEOOOOEEEEOOOO_

His warning system.&#x20;

He checks his Nitech. Flicks the button to the camera view. In the distance is a low flying Nocturne ship heading in his direction.&#x20;

He exhales slowly. Not now. Damn miner’s luck. Not…right…now.&#x20;

Ok, ok, ok. They'll likely just fly straight past. Headed to a disturbance at a neighbouring mine.&#x20;

The whole atmosphere on Pytheas had become hot and heavy since the Great Halving. Everyone waiting for the storm to break.&#x20;

Still, have to follow protocol. Act for a worst case scenario. He grabs a bag. Time to put the invisibility shield on. He yanks out a filthy, hooded cloak identical to Muteys and throws it over his head. He opens a small compartment in the floor and flicks two switches. Everything goes dark.&#x20;

But Hoak doesn't need light. He’s trained this blindfolded. He counts his steps out from the switch. Nine forward, two left. Door. Open. Out into the main mine shaft. Here a little light trickles down from above, but it barely penetrates the gloom. He steps onto his surface booster platform and in seconds he’s flying to the top of the mine, the bright sun burning his eyes as he speeds towards it. At the top the dusty wind hits him hard and full in the face. He reaches for his Nitech. Then stops. No need. The Nocturne ship's near now. Squinting against the sun he sees it descending. Red dust and flaxen sand whipping up all around. Maybe this isn't a drill. He quickly opens his bag. Inside is a bottle of cheap Skrengl whiskey. He climbs under the shade of a lean-to, liberally pours it over himself, tosses the bottle to the ground and lies down next to it.

The dappled, warm sun plays across his face. Wind whips around him. He can feel the low vibration of the nearby mining equipment working. It's almost peaceful. Then in the ground there is another sensation. Rhythmic, growing louder. Boots. They are coming. This is it.&#x20;

A shout, “On your feet, colonist.”&#x20;

Hoak tries to rise, but only makes it halfway before tipping over, making an indistinct jabbering noise, “I urghss ara.”

“I said, on your feet. Now.”

“Ima eurrr,” mumbles Hoak again, making another pretense at getting up and failing.

“Is anyone in this mine?”

“I..i..I…”

The hard-jawed soldier kneels, trying to look in his eyes, “Someone has been scraping our transmissions. Know anything about that?”

Hoak doesn't attempt a response and instead just slumps on the ground.

“Do you know Colonist Hoak Rewhuard?” the trooper is yelling at him now.

“Just leave the drunkard,” says another Nocturne. “We don’t have much time.”

And with that, the six Nocturnes walk right past Hoak Rewhuard.&#x20;

“Flash night!” shouts one and the others repeat it. Their head torches light up.&#x20;

“Down we go boys. He’s probably hiding. Weapons hot.” They all pull out their railguns, jump onto the surface booster platform and drop from sight.&#x20;

Hoak lies on the floor waiting. He counts, “5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Boom.”&#x20;

His whispered boom is matched by an explosion underground.&#x20;

Hoak is always alone. Nocturne travel in groups. The detonator on his surface booster was perfectly calculated to trigger on anything heavier than him and a large bag.&#x20;

He pulls out his Nitech and flicks the switch to his night vision security cameras. Thick smoke’s everywhere. But something’s still moving. Someone survived. A voice splutters, shouts “This Nocturne Unit 2656. Immediate backup needed 5 down. Over. Over!” Nothing. The voice tries again “Nocturne unit 2656 emergency assistance needed. Over.” No response.&#x20;

The radio transmitter blockers he powered up before leaving were working.

So what now? He could leave. Go in search of the cargo. Never return. But, everything here would be gone. Worse, in the hands of the IG. He didn’t like leaving things untidy. He glanced at the bracelet, he could activate the final measure, but he wasn't willing to share yet. Or he could just go down and clean up the mess. He had the night vision cameras. The other guy was in the dark - literally. He could kill him, collect his important items, destroy the bodies and be gone before anyone realized this Unit was missing. Do the work. Just like always.&#x20;

Decision made.

Hoak turns and walks to the other side of the mine. He’d stuck iron rods all the way down the shaft there so he could access or exit without the surface booster. He discards the Mutey cloak, takes one quick look at his night vision cameras on his Nitech and starts to climb into the darkness.

Quickly, the light fades. He also practiced this blindfolded but not with clouds of noxious fumes left from his explosives. He climbs down into a thick smog of grey smoke. The smell is familiar. Like home. He’d used a recipe from his daddy’s factory. Lungs burn, eyes stream. He tries to block it all out but the stench catches at the back of his throat making him gag. Keep going. Nearly there. The smoke envelopes him, consumes him. It’s all he can see. All he can smell. All he can taste. He is in the munitions factory. His daddy is holding him over an industrial size melting pot, so close his nose is nearly touching the virulent green toxic substance they used to make explosive gel blocks. He’d been found asleep under the billet trimmer. He screams, begs, sorry daddy, no daddy no daddy, no until he could no longer make words with all the retching and coughing. He chokes, his body spasming, each breath is agony. Full of sickness. Poison. Blackness comes and he gratefully falls into it.&#x20;

Hoak hits the mine floor with a thud. The impact jolts him back into himself. He lies unmoving. Silence. The Nocturne must have heard the coughing, the fall, had he been shouting? What was wrong with him?

Regroup. He looks longingly at the iron bars and the way out but it's too risky to climb now. Follow the plan. He listens intently but hears nothing. He slips his hand under his shirt and pulls out the rail gun that is strapped to him. Ready to go. His hand goes to his back pocket. It's empty. No console. That miner’s luck again. Did it drop out on his fall? No no no. He can't see anything. The smoke blocks any light from above. Be systematic. Do the work. He starts reaching his hands out over the rocky floor in circles growing out from him. Block everything else out and concentrate. He is rewarded. His fingers feel a familiar hard corner. He grabs at it. His Nitech.

Things went off track there for a moment but he could do this. The night he’d left for Pytheas hadn’t gone perfectly either but he’d got the work done. He’d never forgot the feeling of taking off in his daddy’s cruiser watching the only world he’d ever known disappear behind him. His old family, a burning pile on the floor. His daddy. who loomed so large in his imagination, turning into ash. The shocking realization he had just been flesh and bone after all.&#x20;

Gun poised. Ready. The Nitech would light up, but he just needed the quickest look and then he’d unload the gun in that vicinity.&#x20;

Do the work. Go. Hoak opens the console. Illuminates the night vision camera screen. He sees the warm light of another body so near him their outlines morph into one. He gasps and turns just as a laser fires directly into his head and Hoak crumples.&#x20;

The Nocturne holsters his weapon, flips his head torch back on, and climbs out of the mine.&#x20;

For a while all is still, apart from the dwindling clang of the Nocturne’s boots on the shafts iron bars.

Unlike the Mutey shaped lump, this one doesn’t stir. There is no resurrection. Hoak lies bleeding, his arms splayed out above his head. Around his pale wrist his bracelet stops flashing. For a minute it looks like plain metal. Then it turns a blood red, perfectly matching the shade of the liquid splashed over the rocks before the bracelet melts off his wrist, disappearing into nothingness.&#x20;

But in a recessed hollow, under a secret panel, something emerges. A ping. The hopeful light of a computer booting up. On the screen, all of Hoak’s data files load into a message. The recipient field auto-populates. The first is to a colonist labelled “E.”  9 others follow.

A last act of connection—the message—ascends, while on the dark floor among the lingering scent of spent munitions, Hoak remains.
