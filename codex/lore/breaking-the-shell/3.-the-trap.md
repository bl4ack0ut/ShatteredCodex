# 3. The Trap

So many failed attempts. The Captain of the pirate ship Xibak’sor stares through the window of his quarters recalling the myriad failed maneuvers of his career. Many small successes have come: the capture of fleeing colonist ships, raids on outlying systems, spectacular outmaneuvering of Guild enforcements. But that historic moment, a legendary exploit known throughout the ranks of the Ai-Lax, one recalled and embellished over countless drinks continues to evade. No more. His execution of this cargo capture would be flawless. All contingencies accounted for, the imposter placed, the route known. He despised relying on another captain for the attack. Hated that it was the impulsive young Alaga’kal. And continued to be uneasy at the lack of information about the cargo—the true mystery. But it could not be helped. No other Ai-Lax was reckless enough to help him rob the Guild, and, effectually, no one else would work with him.&#x20;

\-------

Entering the bridge of the Xibak’sor, Exgaath takes the command chair.

“Captain,” comms specialist Maykn says, turning to face Exgaath, “we received the imposter’s transmission of the freighter’s departure time from Anaxima. It also confirms the return route and speed.”

“I want the countdown displayed on every screen shipwide. Bottom right corner. No excuses for failing in readiness.”

“Yessir, the cargo ship crosses these coordinates in precisely 45 hours.”

“Hail the Emaga'ka. I must speak with Captain Alaga’kal.”

The second Ai-Lax ship, the Emaga'ka, hovers near the Xibak'sor under a planetary shadow in this unnamed, outlying star system. Each craft has a massive dark sphere held in its attractor ray. An iridescent cable strung between the two half-constructed globes reels in and out as the strange collection of metal glints in the vacuum.&#x20;

Alaga'kal’s vicious, black-eyed, scarred face appears on the central viewscreen as a 2-foot-tall holographic overlay.&#x20;

“Captain Exgaath. Finally you have the time.”

“Your crew has 24 hours to complete their Zekmaw Orb construction before we must place them and withdraw. Arrival is in 44 hours.”

“My crew moves at twice the speed of the Xibak’s. Handle your own crew’s efforts. Our’s will be complete. Your intel had better be accurate.”

“Veiled threats bore me, Al’agakal. Work, and report when it’s done. Exgaath out.”&#x20;

The apparitional face fades away. Exgaath’s visage hardens more, if possible, as he turns to the transmissions specialist. “Triple check it all. No mistakes or I feed you your entrails.”

\-------

“It’s time. Move your Zekmaw Orb to these coordinates, Alaga'kal. I will run activation protocols from here. Then get your ship behind a local moon or planet. FTL-speed ships that contact the wire destroy the orbs. Anyone too close will be nothing but a forgotten story.”

“_A fool speaks_, Exgaath. Place your orb and we’ll see who tells the stories.”

Dragging cargo in opposite directions, the ships separate. The glistening filament connecting the spheres, too fine for detection by long range scanners, undulates in space catching snatches of light from the nearest star. As the Kakain Chariots stop, their attractor rays power down. Small, periodic flames wink in and out of existence to keep the trap in place. The Xibak'sor and Emaga'ka fade into shadows once more, only their engine emissions visible.

“Captain Exgaath,” comms officer Maykn says, “both Zekmaw are positioned. Estimated time to intercept is 12 hours 19 minutes. ”

“We wait,” Exgaath smiles, turns to his servant, “Spurl! Bring onosia!”

\-------

SCRAW! SCRAW! SCRAW!

“I am already awake. Alarm off.”

A voice over ship’s comms, “The cargo ship is calculated to pass this location within 15 minutes, Captain Exgaath.”

“Send countdown to the Emaga'ka. The FTL drives on the Zekmaw must ignite 1 minute prior to contact. I will be on the bridge in 5 minutes. All hands on.”

Exgaath runs through all the scenarios in his head again as he dresses and makes a final decision. Loading up his Nitech he records a memo to be sent as accompaniment to the emergency data packet. “Tiljer, do you remember that poem you used to recite when we got drunk…”

In three minutes he is out the door.&#x20;

Exactly five minutes have elapsed when Exgaath steps onto the bridge. “Ship-wide comms,” he says.

“This is your captain. The cargo ship will pass in 10 minutes,” his voice echoes through every corridor. “The wire is strung. Results are uncertain but calculated. Prepared to collect space debris scattered over 5 systems if necessary or to immediately move into hyperspace should the ship fail to be sufficiently crippled. Plan for all contingencies. Do not fail me. Exgaath out.”

“Give me the Emaga'ka. Audio only.”

Captain Alaga'kal’s voice immediately grates over the system, “You have fear, Exgaath.”

“Shut your mouth and stand prepared. The freighter is about to pass. Tracking systems must be at full sensitivity. We may only have an instant to plot trajectory.”

“I am always prepared.”

“Captain,” Maykn interjects, “contact in 1 minute, FTL drives online. Fully powered and holding. The line is taut.”

The sensation of leaping on prey is in Exgaath’s mouth. He licks his teeth unconsciously and grips the chair tighter.&#x20;

For a moment, the two crews of two Ai-Lax ships hang in suspended animation in the shadows of an obscure corner of the galaxy.

LIGHT!&#x20;

UNBELIEVABLE LIGHT!

“Contact! Contact! Contact!”

The entire universe is light and the contact shockwaves from the exploding orbs send debris everywhere. The remains of the wire fly by like laser beams.&#x20;

“Analysis!” roars Exgaath.

“Captain! The freighter’s bridge was severed by the wire. The main hull is still in hyperspace, the bridge separated off and is no longer traveling at speed. Its current path will see impact on a planet one system over.”

“Don’t you lose that hull!” Exgaath yelled. “Alaga'kal prepare to move out at my mark.”

“You’ll lose the ship and cargo if you wait longer, Exgaath.”

“And we’ll be destroyed if we go out now.”

“Coward,” spat Alaga'kal, “I’m not waiting for orders from you. Helm follow the cargo! NOW!”

“KAL you fool!”&#x20;

“Captain Exgaath, two Nocturne fighters!”

Too late. At the instant the Emaga'ka attempts to jump to FTL speeds and follow the disabled freighter, two Nocturne ships appear in the path. The Emaga'ka and lead Nocturne ship instantly vaporize in a bolt of metal and light as the former slices through the latter at 550 billion km/sec.

“EVASIVE MANEUVERS!” Exgaath yells. “All hands, hostile Nocturne ship after us. Comms, call any Ai-Lax in the area for immediate assistance.”

“There’s interference, the resonance from the ship collision is scrambling transmissions.”

“Keep trying,” Exgaath orders. “Helm! Get us out of here.”

“They’re right behind us, Captain. Firing proton cannons.”

“Deploy mines. Fire all aft pulse beams.”

“Mines minimally effective, pulse beams deflected. The ship is preparing to fire an antimatter warhead torpedo.”

Terror blinks across Exgaath’s face; for the first time in his life he sees death seeing him.

“Raise aft shields to full.”

“But Captain, our shields can’t stop a torpedo.”

Red lights as the proton cannons strike the Kakain chariot. Ship’s computer voice, _“Impact Damage.”_

“Set the Eonite FTL drive to jump speed, aim it at the Nocturne ship, and eject it.”

“Captain, we’ll be stranded without the drive and there’s no way to precisely aim…”

“DO IT!”

“Calculating.”

Ship’s voice again, _“Antimatter Torpedo Launch Imminent.”_

“We’re out of time!”

“Ejecting!”

The Xibak'sor shudders as its heart leaves its body.

“Rear display,” shouts Exgaath.

The Nocturne ship swells as it nears and in a flash the rear half of the fighter is gone.

“Enemy ship disabled, Captain.”

“Get me long range communications online now.”

Ship’s voice, _“Antimatter Torpedo Launched.”_

Horror. How could Exgaath have expected that the Nocturne, drifting too close to avoid being collateral destruction, would still fire?

_“Impact in 3”_

_“2”_

1…

Two ships, in an obscure corner of the galaxy, disappear in an orb of light.&#x20;

A perfect kill…

\-------

“Captain,” the comms officer of the Nidikori Sa turns in her seat, “I know we are analyzing the departing Guild Carrier data, but I’ve picked up a reinforcement request. Location data and details are incoherent, but it bears the Xibak'sor’s code frequency.”

“Of course it would be Exgaath. Jump the data to my personal Nitech, get me a secure line to Ai-Lax Council,” says Tiljer’mage.&#x20;

After scanning the data he pauses in thought—features motionless—then speaks as though to a ghost, “Something dark is going on. I have a need to illuminate it.”

_\* Zekmaw translates to detach head. The Zekmaw Orbs are a distinctly Ai-Laxian invention. Two spheres are assembled near their predetermined location of use, connected by a Teknite wire alloyed with eonite (making it extremely strong). The Zekmaw would be held in place by small boosters until the time at which they were expected to be used. At that time, the ring-shaped FTL drive on each orb that surrounds the wire ignites, pulling the objects with equal force in opposite directions, maximizing tension. The purpose of the orbs is a simple one: a ship traveling through that route will pass directly through the wire and be sliced through its length. Exact bisection is rare, but sufficient damage is usually accomplished to cripple the vessel and allow for acquisition of the cargo. The device is crude in operation, expensive to deploy, nearly always destroys the attacked ship to a degree of being unusable again, and can only be used once as the wire will break and the orbs explode from the released tension. It is also very effective._&#x20;

_\* “A fool speaks” - An ancient Ai-Laxian proverb relating to the perceived uselessness of speech in relation to action._

_\* Spurl is a pejorative term used for any weak pirate crew member, usually a servant, it was the name of a long, thin aquatic worm on Hassur that would clone constantly, but tasted terrible, was good for nothing, and was generally a nuisance as it oozed a sticky gelatinous mess when touched._
