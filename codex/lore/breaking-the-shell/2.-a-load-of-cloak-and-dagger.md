# 2. A Load of Cloak and Dagger

“Never been here, never asked,” replied Flight-Lieutenant Katrina Marshall, captain of the Olepe Prime, as she finished docking procedures.&#x20;

The Flight-Officer next to her, wearing a uniform labeled “Motschick”, expected the no nonsense reply from his superior and decided against his next set of questions: what cargo they were collecting and where they were taking it. After all, he already knew the destination, the burning question was the cargo.

Marshall removed her headset, flicked a myriad of switches on the ship's control panel and turned to her copilot. The instant she is unattentive a set of symbols flash across the display, some kind of partially decrypted dataset associated with the manifest.

"Go to the cargo bay and oversee the loading of the…..what the hell are you doing?" She snapped.

He was wincing, with two fingers shoved in his mouth, "Sorry ma'am, just a bit of toothache," he mumbled.

"Well, pull your fingers out of your craw and get to the cargo bay," Marshall barked.

“Yes, ma’am,” he responded eagerly.

The real Tober Motschick had earned his wings from Ring’s Academy, a premier flight school, and had been a bit green and a bit _too_ keen for the more seasoned pilots. This imposter however, was highly-trained; an exceptional pilot skilled in the art of subterfuge, explosives and heavy weapons.

Fake Tober jumped out of his seat, swift to please, and headed to the flight deck.

He counted his steps all the way down to the cargo bay. A little thing to keep his mind in character; he tried his best to retain any information about the Olepe’s interior which might come in useful, either to help him on his mission or as a good source of intel for the Ai-Lax.

He thought back to his own ship—the Lataka Ro, that humble Corvette—and focused on how much this mission would net him. I’m going to captain a Harbinger by the time this is all done.&#x20;

If only I had access to my ship’s inventory, he thought, even a standard-issue DRU would be enough. I could simply throw the thing into any corner and I’d have a full floorplan of the interiors and corridors of all the surrounding areas. Instead, I’m forced to count steps.&#x20;

The huge cargo door was being lowered when Fake Tober entered the cargo bay. He felt the sudden rush of heat sweep over him and had to wait for his eyes to adjust to the blinding light spewing in. The auto-dim function on his standard issue helmet visor wasn’t great and, not for the first time, he laughed inwardly at how inferior some of the Imperial Guild’s equipment seemed to be.

So this is Anaxima, he thought. He tried to get a good look at the mysterious planet’s landscape whilst walking toward the solitary figure waiting at the top of the ramp.

“Help you, sir?” demanded the massive guard.

“Flight-Officer Motschick, sir. I have orders for one pick up,” the imposter had to practically yell over the incessant noise of the heavy industrial machinery on the landing deck.

He handed over the manifest to the heavily-armed Nocturne soldier who studied it narrowly until he was happy with its legitimacy. Handing it back to Fake Tober, the guard turned on his heels and signaled to his crew to bring the consignment on board.&#x20;

Flight-Lieutenant Marshall watched the cargo being loaded onto the ship through the cockpit monitor and had to ask herself, “Why the hell are six Nocturne grunts and three lab techs needed to secure such a small package onto my ship?”

She saw her copilot being handed the itinerary docket by one of the scientists and buzzed him through her headset, “Motschick. What exactly is listed on that docket?”

“Erm…SC446…one count…vitamin D inducer,” declaimed Ben.

“Damn cloak and dagger…,” muttered Katrina.

“What’s that, ma’am?”

“I wasn’t talking to you, Motschick. Wrap it up down there and get the crew to strap that consignment in the Prime’s hold like they’re strapping a newborn to an outbounder. Do not, I repeat, do not let any of the colonists we’ve got in transportation see that thing. No one is supposed to know about this but cleared personnel.”

“Tober” relayed the instructions to Sergeant Anders, the cargo crew lead, and headed back to the flight deck. While counting his steps, he reminded himself that a young, eager puppy dog was the role to play, and one he must play until this mission was concluded.&#x20;

His tongue prodded at his teeth as though trying to find a piece of leftover food. He opened his mouth and pretended to scrape at one of his upper molars, while in actuality he triple-tapped the false tooth which contained the concealed tracker-transmitter and whispered, “Encode : Package onboard, repeat, package onboard, prepare to intercept. Flight path and speed to follow. Transmit to Xibak’sor.”
