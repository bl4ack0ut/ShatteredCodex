# 7. Jump Shock

“We expect you to accomplish the impossible.”

That voice. It echoes down the hallway. Somehow coming at me from all sides, burrowing into my brain, and it keeps caroming off the inside of my skull looking for a way out again. Soft. Deep. Powerful.

“Yes, Halogen Vias. Consider it done.”

“Only what is done, is done.”

The figure disappears like a shadow.

Only once since entering the Nocturne have I seen a Halogen. I tried later to draw him, write a description, nothing. I might as well try to describe the pattern at the bottom of a pool of water—each ribbon of light somehow the same but ever-shifting, ever-changing. Others tell me the same thing, looking at one of them is like watching smoke, or light, or water—you know they’re there, but pinning an appearance down is like swimming through sand; it gets you nowhere.

“Attention,” our General, Kilokan, leader of the Nocturne, is shaken. His half-down eyelids tell me he is processing hundreds, maybe thousands of potential scenarios in his mind.&#x20;

“We have a mission directly from High Council. A cargo freighter en route from Anaxima has been lost from communication. An emergency transmission arrived, then cut off. Standard long range relay beacons deployed, however damage to the ship has resulted in a scrambled transmission. Two of our Helix ships were accompanying as a security detail. We believe Ai-Lax are involved. A complete current report is being uploaded to your HUD now. Study it as you outfit. Final orders will load once we are in the air. This mission is unique in both difficulty of accomplishment and importance of success. No distinction separates failure and death. We jump in 1 hour. Dismissed.”

My Nocturne unit, Helix Edge, moves quickly. Tactical, elite, precise. The Guild taps us when missions are critical. Double-time to the outfitting bay, the Nuke (aka the Nucleus). We pack gear; teknite blades for close quarters work, disruptor sidearm, railgun primary, stun grenades, explosive packs, medkits, featherweight tacvests, emergency onosia and food concentrates. Once each man equips, a process which takes under 15 minutes, we assemble in the center of the Nuke, for the ritual collective glass of onosia. Every man dips his chalice. Our missing brothers are felt.

“Make a hole.” General Kilokan enters our circle in full tac gear and fills his cup from the bowl. Twenty-four eyes snap his direction. “Nocturne,” his icey blue gaze sweeps over us, “Tradition guides our service. Master the eye. No trust in luck. Eternally centered!”&#x20;

“Eternally centered!” every man replies. Thirteen glasses empty.&#x20;

The General, myself, and two other senior Helix pick up four more chalices. One-by-one we rip the base and stem from the cups and hang them on the wall after removing the teknite projectile hidden inside. The cups we drop into the furnace recycler.&#x20;

One-by-one we chamber our weapons with the reclaimed projectile.&#x20;

One-by-one the phrase spoken, “Your memory. My ammunition.”

Kilokan breaks the ceremony, “To your fighters.”

\-------

Each two man team is in their fighter running final checks before we jump. The seven Helix fighters are arranged down the hangar bay of an Imperial Fleet Cruiser. It’ll likely be about a day of travel, even at the 10,000 LYD top end, but we’ve been told to be ready to launch from the bay at any moment.&#x20;

_Jump in 20 minutes…_the announcement overlays every comms channel in the cruiser. Everyone is warned to prepare for the inertial isolation of the craft. It prevents the ships from ripping through the bulkhead and our skeletons from ripping through our organs during the instant of acceleration. It also produces a non-ignorable electrical pulse through your muscles, a full body ripple—like leaping into a freezing river naked. We call it “Jump Shock”.

In the pilot seat, my HUD feeds me data from the mission files. Details are scanty. Freighter to Anaxima carrying ghost cargo. Pick up real cargo. Freighter on return with two Nocturne fighter protection escort. So they expected possibility of trouble but didn’t want to advertise it. Fighters were armed to the teeth though. Then…something happened to the freighter to damage it while traveling at 5000 LYD. Theory is it was one of the tripwires the pirates have been rumored to have developed. Nocturne escort encounter a couple of Ai-Lax. Then nothing but scrambled code. Some kind of interference weapon? And no further word from the Nocturne guard? Since when are those shanty town pirates sharp enough to take down two fighters? We’ll need caution in case they really do have some new weapons tech. What piece of cargo could be so important that the Halogens are willing to send a massive Nocturne contingent, the entire Helix Edge, and put the threat of death on the line for failure?

_Jump in 10 minutes…_

My secondary, seated behind me, cuts my thoughts, “Comms check. 1-2. 1-2.”

“I read you clear, Keeon,” I reply. “Let’s wrap it up, we jump soon. Have you run through the mission files?”

“Your job, Agony. I’ll flip through it on the way.”

“Liar,” I laugh, “You know you’re gonna be cruising the ship looking for girls, in the mess trying to win eon off the crew, or sharpening your knives.”

“Who? Me?” He says with mock sincerity.

“Seriously, Kee. Read this one. Something deeper is going on. Some thread, some strand of the story I can’t quite get my hand on. We don’t lose four from the Helix for nothing. And there’s a link or file attached, but I don’t have access to it. I need you to see if it’s just a malfunction on my system.”

“Enough chatter on comms,” General Kilokan cuts in, “All Helix, briefing in 5, I expect you to have reviewed all prior mission data.”

“General,” I say without thinking.

“Yes, Ranger Agonis.”

“Sir…what the hell was this freighter hauling?”

The comms are suddenly flat. The General cut all transmissions.

_1 minute…prepare for jump_

We power down the fighter and head through the hangar. Halfway I stop short. My mind is flooded with a vision. They come sometimes. As though out of body, I hover above the Nucleus looking down on twelve men. On four empty slots. My brothers gone. Rehawk. Bowcom. Sodek. Romcik. Anger flashes through my brain like lightning. My blood boils in my veins. It makes no _sense_. My fist flies out half-crushing the nearest metal pipe. The sound cracks like a gunshot through the bay and turns every nearby head.

“Ag! What the hell?”

My fists won’t unclench, “I swear Kee, if they show their filthy faces, my knife will drink pirate blood.”

“Hot-headed soldiers make mistakes, Agony.”&#x20;

_Jump. Jump. Jump._

Three red light strobe flash pulses tell everyone the stone is thrown, the ripple comes.

But I’m already cold through.
