# 6. The VQ Decide

“...when you know, do.” The infamous strapline of Paul Terring, anchorman for the Pytheas World News.&#x20;

_Ping!_&#x20;

Kyle switched off the telescreen, opened his closed loop Nitech and checked the incoming message, “Oh crap!”, he swiped away the message and quickly typed the following words ‘DEADMAN SWITCH ACTIVATED. HOAK DEAD. IMMEDIATE MEETING!’ and clicked send.

He snapped the comms device shut, grabbed his jacket off the back of the sofa, exited his apartment and walked two doors down the hallway to the makeshift operations room the underground movement, aka the VQ, called home.&#x20;

He tapped on the door six times and coughed, not the most subtle of secret knocks but it worked for now. The door opened and Kyle walked in, he was met with a blaster pointing in his face, the young man holding the blaster raised his free hand into the air and stuck up his index finger and thumb. Kyle replied by raising his fist and sticking his pinky finger up.&#x20;

‘_May a thousand monkeys bite my eyes_’ thought Kyle. The amateurishness of the safety procedures they went through was laughable.

The armed man lowered his blaster, happy that the person in the doorway was actually Kyle and not some imposter, he smiled and asked him if he wanted a drink.

Kyle quickly replied, “Nope. Have you heard from the others?”

“Erm.. no. Why?” answered the young man.

“Have you checked your Nitech?”

“....sorry Kyle, no I haven't.”

“For god’s sake Wade, wake up. The whole operation is all over IG chatter. They’re reporting that a cargo ship and two Nocturne fighters have been destroyed. There's the usual talk of pinning the blame on the Ai-Lax, but there was also mention of it being espionage instigated by the anarchist group VQ.”

“That's us!” exclaimed Wade, rather excitedly.

“IT’S NOT SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT!!...” shouted Kyle, the stupidity of the boy still astounded him, “It’s too soon after Pylon for something so big. We need to stay out of the Guild’s eye for a little while,” Kyle continued, “we’re still small.”&#x20;

“But we’re a secret organization fighting for the struggle of the people,” Wade countered.&#x20;

‘_Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’re such an elite fighting force that when we walk into a room we have to stick our pinkies up in the air so we don't get shot in the face_,’ thought Kyle.

Kyle Vasano had only recently been promoted to his new role of Foreman at this VQ cell following the untimely death of his mentor, Enzo Zenamann. Enzo passed away due to an unfortunate accident when a MAG2 plasma welder contacted Enzo's newly fitted titanium leg brace. The scrap molten titanium covered his funeral costs.

The VQ had split their organisation into multiple cells in order to avoid the prying eyes of the Guild. Each cell had a lead officer, a Foreman, who was in direct communication with only two to four other leaders of the VQ. Nobody outside of the inner circle knew the number or names of the leaders.

The Imperial Guild knew of the VQ; had declared them anarchists. Kyle scoffed at this term, neither he, nor his compatriots, wanted to live in a stateless society, they just wanted liberation from the mighty grip that the Imperial Guild had on the colonists of Pytheas.

Kyle ran his cell in exactly the same way he was taught, with a quote etched onto his brain, ‘With power and hierarchy brings mistrust.’

He never fully understood the VQ’s raison d'etre until he saw the enthusiasm and commitment of new recruits.

If new recruits join a movement where hierarchy and power is already in place, they get spooked and they don’t feel as important as they would if they were in it from the beginning. However, make an organisation look and feel a bit amatuer, then the new recruits feel like they’ve joined at the start of something big, which makes them feel special and more importantly, instrumental to the movement.

There was a knock at the door, “Who is it?” shouted Wade.

“Open the door, man, it’s Scully,” came the reply.

“Identify yourself!” Wade yelled out.

An audible sigh came from the other side of the door, followed by six powerful knocks, another sigh, then a loud cough.

Wade reached for the door handle, positioning his blaster at head height while slowly opening the door.&#x20;

In walked a hulk of a man who looked in dire need of a sit down.&#x20;

Wade lifted up his fist but before he could repeat the ridiculous routine hand gesture, Kyle screamed at him, “GIVE IT A REST WADE!! WE CAN SEE IT’S SCULLY!”

“I’m only following the orders you gave me Kyle, sorry for doing as I’m told.”

Kyle stared at him, trying desperately to control his breathing in order to keep his rapidly rising stress levels from rising any higher, “Just get the table out please, Wade.”

Scully puffed out his chest, walked over to a chair which looked comically small in relation to his heft, and sat down, “The others just pulled up as I entered the building,” he said.&#x20;

Almost on cue, three more figures appeared down the hallway and walked purposefully towards the apartment door.

\--------

“So, we have intel pointing to the ship's direction. But it never reached the destination because it’s been at least damaged, maybe destroyed. We don’t know the exact whereabouts of the ship. We don’t even know what parts of the ship are still intact, if any? Haha! Great! Easy as pie.” stated Roy. His grey suit looked crumpled and unwashed but he still cut a fine figure.

Wade answered, “Let’s put away the sarcasm, Roy. Look, Hoak’s data files show his tracker had data of straight travel. Suddenly the signal veered sharply. Then it stopped. We can track the trajectory after the course change. It looks like somewhere in the Xathika system, though we can’t be sure. The sudden course change seemed unnatural also. It’s possible there was some damage that occurred to the ship causing it to drop out of hyperspace suddenly. We don’t really know. But we’ve got two completely usable data points to start with. The place where the course suddenly changed and that star system. I don’t think anyone realizes what we’re dealing with yet.”&#x20;

“Can I interrupt?” asked the extremely thin woman sitting on the arm of the sofa. Unbeknownst to her compatriots she had been bluejacking files from Kyle’s Nitech and sending the data to a personal memchip as a contingency. An oddly designated file causes a hiccup in the download, she pigeonholes it as something to examine later.​​ She went on, “Have we begun a search and rescue mission?”

Everyone looked at Kyle, “Have ‘WE’ begun a search and rescue mission? By ‘WE’ do you mean ‘ME’? Because no. Considering I got the data two hours ago, no I haven’t run out to the hinterlands of the cosmos yet,” snapped Kyle, his face flushed.

“Now come on Kyle, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m more than happy to contact the relevant parties to get the ball rolling. I just meant I need to know if you, or anyone else, has made the call yet.” replied Moneta, her soothing eyes making direct contact with Kyle.

“No. I haven’t made the call, not yet. I wanted to discuss what info we received from Hoak before we decide on next steps,” came the calmer reply from Kyle.

“Well, I think getting to those locations needs to be immediate,” Moneta replied, “Time is not on our side. If what that data dump indicates is accurate, there may be something completely game changing out there. Something that could shift the whole power dynamic between the colonists of Pytheas and the Guild.”&#x20;

Nods of agreement came from all the heads in the room.&#x20;

“Right, I’m on it,” Kyle stood up, walked to the corner of the room, and began sending coded messages to the other VQ cell leaders on his Nitech.

When he came back to the group his head was on straight and level. He was in command of his group, “For the next couple of hours I want everyone here doing three things. Moneta and Roy, I need you two running through a list of everything you can think of that we might need on the mission: food concentrates, surface breathing suits, weapons, scanning equipment. I’ll submit it to our supply chain when you’re done. Arlan and Scully, I need you two to sit down and go through every single piece of data Hoak sent to us. Look for anything that can help. We don’t know what we’re going to be up against out there, but you’d better believe there’s going to be danger from the Guild or Pirates or who knows what else. Wade. Look man, I need you to boot up any transmission scanning equipment we’ve got and get on it. I want to know what the Guild is doing, what the Ai-Lax are doing, what any other scavengers are doing, anything at all you can get data on, I need it and I need it in real time. Questions?”

“What are you gonna be doing?” Arlan asked.

“I’m going to Hoak’s place.”

“Are you INSANE!?”

It was impossible to tell who yelled it because they all did.

“I know. It seems crazy. But before we go, I need to see what happened. Hoak was a good guy. A careful guy. And he believed in what we’re doing. I can’t just let it go.” Kyle took a deep breath, pulled Wade off to the side and looked him dead in the eyes. “Listen, Wade, if anything happens. You’re in charge. You know what to do. You know all the protocols. I’ll be back soon. But if I’m not, you better find whatever it is everyone is looking for. This could be the key to finally take some of our own power.”
