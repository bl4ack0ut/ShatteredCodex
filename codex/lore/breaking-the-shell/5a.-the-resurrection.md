# 5a. The Resurrection

Jar shuts the heavy Paradise doors behind the last customer and slams the heavy duty bolts across. People are always telling him to upgrade to an OmsaTek security system, but he enjoys the feeling of sliding the metal himself; the tension in his neck eases with each satisfying clunk.&#x20;

He starts his nightly search for lost property (now his property) when he bumps up against  something unexpectedly soft. Mutey. He wearily kneels down. Jar is an expert at the quick pulse check to distinguish between a stiff and a blackout. He’s pleased to feel Mutey is warm with a strong pulse. Nothing else he could do. Paradise ain’t no daycare. He heads out of the back door to his bunk room above the bar, only to return minutes later and place a blanket over Mutey before heading to bed.

For a while all is still, apart from the faint hum of the air conditioning. Then the Mutey lump stirs, scans the room and rises. What has emerged isn’t the stooped and shaking Mutey but colonist miner Hoak Rewhuard.

Hoak is the opposite of the man who smashed a glass on his head a few hours earlier. His daddy never gave him anything, apart from a couple of nasty concussions. He’d learnt early there was no point in talking about things. He just had to get on with them. Do the work.&#x20;

So when, on Pytheas, one of his projects picked up faint whispers in the airwaves of something significant, something that could turn around a man's fortune, he didn’t say anything to anybody.  He quietly locked away his mining equipment and disappeared that night. Reappearing as Mutey in the only place he had any chance of finding out more: Paradise.&#x20;

In the galaxy, misfortune worked better than any invisibility shield. Destitution removed a man’s humanity. To recognise the poor and broken, meant also recognising the fragility that separated their circumstances from your own.&#x20;

So he spent his days in Paradise. Hunched and hidden. Disregarded. Unseen. Scrubbing piss and vomit off tables and toilets. Picking up jabbie ends. Finding hard, freezing corners to sleep in at night. Then Tober walked into the bar, and his self-imposed mission was complete.&#x20;

After rising, Hoak stretches his arms behind his neck. Lying still for that long is harder than taking a beating from the likes of Tober. He wipes some of the blood out of his eyes with the back of his sleeve, takes his Nitech out of a small concealed pocket in his cloak and opens it. Let it work, letitwork, letitwork he prays under his breath. And there it is. A perfect green dot blinking on the screen. Appended to the dot is a selectable, brief data readout. Hoak closes the readout, hiding it from view, intending to bring it back up later and examine it. The dot is there, that’s enough for now.

He heads to the door. Pauses. Turns back to the bar and reaches over to grab a beer. I deserve a celebratory drink, he thinks. He deftly cracks it open, swigs down a large gulp. What was it that clown said just before he cracked him over the head? Oh yeah, “To me making it.” Tober wanted everyone to drink to him. But no one had. Well, his old friend Mutey will. He raises his beer high. To Tober. And more, here’s to that tracker I placed on his pilot jacket. The one that is going to give me my chance of making it too.&#x20;

Downing the last of the bottle, Hoak picks up the blanket Jar had covered him with. It's been slowly soaking up the blood and beer. Hoak sighs and digs in his pocket for some coin, chucks what he has on the bar, unbolts the door and walks out of Paradise.
