# Arrival

Desolate. There’s no other word to describe what’s below. Or is it ahead? The entire planet is bleak—sharp mountain rifts break through an empty wasteland of flax-colored dust.

Suddenly a voice comes over the comms, “This is an official Imperial Guild clearance communication. State your purpose at Pytheas.”

It’s startling, but expected. “I am a Colonist here to claim a mining parcel.”

“Submit your credentials and fee through the Remittance Port now. Do not proceed until instructed.”

Waiting above the surface is the worst fear. Rumors have been constantly communicated that Ai-Lax Pirates are flooding into the Omorphia System along with the ever increasing stream of other distant denizens coming to claim and mine.

“Credentials and payment accepted. You will proceed to the Mine plot indicated on your transcorder display. Drop ship at coordinates PN-03-04-HG10GF only. The barriers of your mining plot are indicated in the same transmission. As you are aware, all mining rights are on lease to you and any crew you employ. The land is retained under ownership by the Imperial Guild. Welcome to Pytheas.”

“Thank you.” I started to say, but the transmission was already cut off. Looking out the window, beyond the HUD I could see why. The sky over Pytheas was filling with more and more spaceships carrying soon-to-be miners.

Coordinates plotted in. Decent protocol engaged. Time to see what lay ahead. I take a last glance behind; everything that meant anything stuffed back there. Not that much personal stuff, since I sold most everything for mining equipment and the mining claim fees.

Waiting for the dust to clear after touch down. The comms boom again, “Colonist! Our instruments indicate you have landed at your destination. Please immediately reverify your identity. Failure to respond in the next minute will result in a Nocturne unit being dispatched to your location.”

I had started to fade out a little after the long journey. I jumped forward. “Colonist here. Transmission being sent.”

“Identity confirmed. May you find more than you dreamt of on Pytheas.”

And with that I was on my own. Nothing but the whipping sound of wind across the hull and metallic creak of the ship on its landing gear. Ok, time to check it out. Let’s go.

Step from the hatch and I suddenly feel very heady, like the lights get turned up in my mind. It’s the faint levels of Eonite dust in the atmosphere. Dust whips rapidly around, choking the air. Dip back in the hatch. Don some protective gear. And step out for real.

This is it. Home. I get rich, or die trying. The adventure is on.
