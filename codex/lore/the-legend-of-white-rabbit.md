# The Legend of White Rabbit

I never asked to be Ai-Lax. But Ai-Lax don’t ask. They take.&#x20;

“Rabbit!” Rhotax snarls over ships comms, “To the bridge. Bring the Onosia I’ve been saving from my quarters. Today is celebration!”&#x20;

I’m down the fetid corridors quickly. Even at 41 I move with the speed of a 15 year old, faster than most pirates because I train. No fealty. No one respects a sheathed sword.&#x20;

“Oomph!” Talaxad and I collide at a corner. I’m instantly on my feet. “You heard the Captain call me!” I snarl in his face grabbing his vest, “Watch how you take your corners or you’ll find my blade separating you from your manhood while your sleep!” and I’m gone before he can answer. He knows it’s no empty threat.&#x20;

Rhotax’s quarters are disgusting. Almost all personal quarters on the Ya’an Telgol\* are. Certainly it’s that way on all Pirate ships. Stench of vinegar on everything, endlessly. The Onosia case is on the shelf set into a wall on the far side below the gold-gilt box that never moved. The case feels so light I open it to inspect—sure enough, only 3 bottles. Down the hall, up the lift to the bridge. I hear laughter before the doors open.&#x20;

“Permission.” It’s a demand. Ai-Lax don’t ask.&#x20;

“Granted.” Rhotax replies without turning. “You take too long.”&#x20;

He and a few other ship captains gathered to talk strategy on how to handle the influx of Colonists in the Omorphia system.&#x20;

He takes the case and glares at me, “Feels light.”&#x20;

“Stop drinking, you’ll have more,” I snap back.&#x20;

“Get off my bridge, Rabbit. Go inventory supplies. You don’t belong here.”&#x20;

I slip behind him in an instant, my blade tip at his throat. I whisper to his right temple, “My name..is not Rabbit.”&#x20;

He mutters something disgusting under his breath in Hassurian so I push softly and a single drop of blood runs down the steel.&#x20;

“Get off my bridge, Peyok, or I tell the captains to shoot us both.” The men at the table draw guns and blasters. “You know they’ll do it happily.”&#x20;

My knife disappears back in the hidden sheath. “I’m leaving because you reek like lak’hal, I have to go wash your filth of my blade now.”&#x20;

Lift doors shut behind me and I hear laughter erupt on the bridge again.&#x20;

_Ya’an Telgol means Pale Spectre in the ancient Hassurian language. For some reason, unknown, the Ai-Lax have continued to keep alive the old tongue ever since the destruction of Hassur. All Pirates are required to read and learn it so that they can understand Hassurian commands and texts while serving aboard the Kakain ships._&#x20;

_Peyok sounds like the Hassurian word Peh’iok, which means rabbit._&#x20;

_lak’hal - the excrement of one in the process of dying._

_------------_

We are trawling. We could run the FTL drives full out and be to Pytheas in no time. But Rhotax wants to waylay unsuspecting travelers in the process, gather supplies. We've wiped out three incoming Miners. All single roughneck outworlders. Hook them with the attractor ray, draw them to a stop, board, end resistance (if any), take 90% of the food, money, supplies, give survivors a thrashing they live through but don’t forget, send them limping away. Same game plan, every ship.

Rhotax found three cases of Guild Onosia on the last ship. Who knows how in hell the guy piloting got his hands on it, but there it was green and luminous. Now it belongs to that scurvy rat-faced pillock. It’s gonna be a bad few days.

_------------_

“Come on ya grimy slimebuckets!” Rhotax is blasted on Onosia, hollering over the ships comms, “It’s time to have some FUN!”

We snagged another ship and all hands rush to the airlock to be first to the spoils. Commotion on the other side of the steel.

“Now hear this Colonist ship!” Rhotax is blasting on the captured ship’s comms now, “Surrender ya goods, put up no struggles, and we’ll let you go without bloodshed. Put up a fight and you’ll never eat another meal.”

Silence.

We all back to the sides of the airlock doors to avoid the incoming volley of blasts that they always let off. My heart races. Not from fear. I stopped being afraid long ago. It’s excitement. Tactical maneuvers flash through my mind, adjustments, calculations, expectations, a thousand if-then statements in an instant. I hear the clamps roll back, the snake hiss of pressurization, grinding of metal doors, pneumatics crying as the other ship’s doors are forced back and then illumination. The whole world is red fire and burning steel and electrical smells but I’m calm. Once it starts, I’m always calm. Assess their firing pattern. As always, concentrated to the center, but not enough for there to be more than six hands holding blasters, two high shooting, one low, two adults one teen maybe, take out the legs first, I crouch down, gun at the lowest corner and I fire a rapid succession of bursts sweeping across the floor from side to side. I hear someone in pain and the lowest set of shooting stops, then one of the highs. Blasts firing at the low corner where I was. Rhotax leans out from the opposite side, fires a single shot. Howl of injury. Wild, everywhere blasting. Slowing. Slowing. I slip out and single shot the man in his only remaining arm, watching it vaporize in plasma. The crew rushes in before the man hits the ground. Blasters are at the Colonist’s temples as Rhotax and I come last. Shoulder to shoulder. Sweeping corners as we go. Disrespect is everywhere but a fight. When we deal death, I am queen.

Behind the barrier a woman tends to an unconscious teen with a melted hump where his left foot was. Beside them the armless man is in shock, verging on complete mental abandonment. I line up my sight with his forehead. Rhotax slaps him until he’s lucid. Flat thwacking noises that echo in the sudden quiet. The man’s eyes cease swimming and get hard from the pain where his limbs were.

“There are others on board.” Rhotax says, almost politely.

The man shakes his head vigorously.

“You have valuable cargo.”

“Nuh..nothing.”

Rhotax’s eyes blaze. “YOUR GOING TO PYTHEAS! YOU NEED A BUY IN FOR THE CLAIM AND EQUIPMENT! DON’T TELL ME NOTHING!” Thwack!

“I swear! We are going as Guild hires, that’s why I have my family. We’ve brought nothing but our clothes, food, a few books, some personal items.”

He’s telling the truth. I can read it on him. But Rhotax is raging now, furious to have lost expected gains and he probably drank a case of Onosia to himself over the last two days.

He grabs the woman by the hair, ripping her from her son. “Tell me where the cargo of value is on this ship, or so help me I will put you in an airlock, give my whole crew relief with your woman while you watch, then empty your son of his organs, and eject you all into space together.”

The man’s eyes go wide, his stubs move back and forth as the arms which no longer exist search for weapons that would do him no good.

“There’s Nothing!” he screams.

“As you wish,” Rhotax sneers turning to the Pirates. “My turn first then I throw her to the ARRGH!” The woman drops from his claw as he grasps his side in pain.&#x20;

Silent as the night, a young boy has slipped behind Rhotax and put a blade between his ribs. In a fueled rage the captain snatches him up by his hair puts his blaster to his chest, looks in the father’s eyes, and pulls the trigger. The child’s center zapps out of existence.&#x20;

Rhotax disintegrates the wife’s head, destroys the teen the next moment.

“Now,” Rhotax is hyperventilating, “I suppose there’s no incentive left for you but pain.”&#x20;

He turns to me, “Your blade, Rabbit.” I hesitate. He’s never killed a child in my sight before. “BLADE!”&#x20;

I relinquish it. And fix my face into a malicious grin I know is necessary to avoid feeling the edge myself.&#x20;

“I thirst, Peyok. Bring me a bottle. I’ve much work to do on this one.”

\------------

Four hours and considerable effort. There was nothing else. It was all true. Nothing of value but some EON fragments in a safe and some food. The man is dead. I have my blade back. Rhotax insists on keeping the Colonist ship one day more to strip it bare looking for something hidden.

He’s called me to dine with him.

\------------

“You fought fearsomely today.”

“hmm” I say through the food.

“You delayed to pass me your blade.” Of course he noticed. He sees all weakness. “You think you’ve never seen a child die by my hand.”

“You know I haven’t.”

“You’ve forgotten the last time.” He empties his glass and pours another. He’s already three bottles deep and his aim is bad, he spills half on the table. He drains that glass too then stumbles towards the hollow in the wall to get another bottle. Except instead he picks up the gilded box and brings it over. With a sweep of his arm he sends plates, glasses, and remnants of our meal to the floor. The box takes their place.

“Op’n it.” he slurs.

“Tell me what it is.”

“Jus op’n it.”

The lid slides away on a corner hinge. Inside is the most pure, dazzlingly bone white piece of fabric I’ve ever seen. It’s got a collar of some kind. I lift it out and it’s weighty, but slides like silk along itself. Seamless, spotless, without a wrinkle, it unfolds into a cloak and my mind unfolds with it.

\------------

I’m scared something bad is happening. Daddy hid me in the alcove in the bedroom and said not to come out. He had his gun and put on his cloak and he only did that for important things. Momma too she had her gun and cloak. And I think I saw Momma give a gun to Ala’kue but he’s only twelve, and Daddy said no guns until fifteen so that’s not right. They left me all alone and the warning lights are going off like the time we hit an asteroid, but Daddy said it’s no asteroid and now I’m alone and it’s not right either. Guns mean fighting and I’m more scared now, but everything’s quiet. Oh! That big noise, it sounds like something pulling pieces off the ship. Those sounds, that’s blasters, I’ve heard that before but there’s so many it’s so loud. Momma screaming! Someone’s coming! It’s Ala’kue, he’s in the doorway shooting. AHHH! KUE! NOOO! I’m out of the alcove rushing to him when a man steps in the room blaster out shoots Kue in the face no Kue no Kue no Kue no let go of me youkilledkueandmymommyandmydaddynonokueno……

\------------

The flashback fades out and I’m back and I look at his face and I remember. You killed Kue. It was Rhotax, Rhotax killed my brother and my mother and my father and before I know it my knife is against his throat again and I feel the resistance disappear as it slides through gristle and sinew and bone and he’s gone but I’m not satisfied. I know he keeps thermal charges in his personal armory. I hurry to collect them and two blasters and…I know now, that cloak, it was my father’s mark of office. We were a royal family, but I can’t remember where from. We were on a mission, I can’t remember what for, or why, but it was peace. And he slaughtered us. The cloak is mine. My mark. I sweep it on my neck and feel the weight on my shoulders. The hood slides up without effort. It feels fitted. Feels right.

I’m darting out of the room, moving through the Kakain ship with the most speed and stealth of my life. Thermal charge near the FTL drive, charge in the cargo hold, charge in the armory, charge in the lift, everywhere it’s most destructive charge charge charge until I’m out. I move to the bridge, draw my knife and Talaxad, on night watch, is dead before he turns around. I disable the alarms and flee to the Colonist’s ship still docked.

Release the clamps, set the dock to auto disengage and board the ship. I’ll deal with the bodies later. I have only moments. Power on, ramp up the thrusters, I hear the dock release, and I’m off at full speed. I’ve only travelled a few seconds when the sensors register the concussion behind me. But the ship is well made and it holds together.

I’m free.

\------------

I know where I’m going. Someone knows about my family. Some Ai-Lax captain. Someone in the Guild. Some wandering Colonist on the surface. I’m going to find them. One of them will recognize this robe. Recognize my name. I must know.

\------------

“We were under the impression that it was a family coming to work under our employ. Who are you?”

“No, no. It was a mix up. Just me, no family. You can see my credentials are valid.”

“Well, with all the new hires coming on, I can see how that could have happened. With your background, you’ll be working in Colonist-Guild relations. You’ll be travelling around the planet, and occasionally up to Hyperion to communicate with current and potential claim holders to assess current needs and issues arising. Predominantly the complaint will be around the blockade and taxation, so smooth their anger on that as best you can. Essentially, it is not within our sphere to run protection anywhere but our personal facilities and within limited parameters on the surface of Pytheas. Full reports due weekly. Here are stipends and communication devices. We’ll need to reprogram your identification chip. Please speak your name into the microphone.”

“Ya’an Peyok”

“Does this look right?”

“Sir.”

“Excellent. Ya’an Peyok…what an uncommon name. What does it mean?”

“Oh…who knows any more.”

“True, so much knowledge has been lost with time. Well, Ya’an, that’s everything. Just remember two principles: help others, do what’s right; and you will be rewarded.”

“Thank you, sir. I’ll do my best.”

\------------

Night on Pytheas. I exit the quarters in silence. I have work to accomplish, I heard an Ai-Lax team is terrorizing a local mining camp and so I will begin there. They will know my blade. They will know my robe. They will know my name. Rhotax misinterpreted. Hassurian texts loaded on the Guild systems tell me Ya’an is not “pale”. Ya’an is “white”.

I am Ya’an Peh’iok.

White Rabbit.
