# Hassur

Hassur was a lush, vibrant, plentiful planet. It was home to an abundance of diverse biological flora and fauna. In addition, there were vast skyflung cityscapes and a robust technological output. The planet was the fourth in a system of seven planets. It was destroyed by a massive asteroid impact that fractured it into millions of pieces, vaporizing the surface and atmosphere in the process. Thankfully, the coming disaster was detected far in advance of its occurrence. Sadly, technological limitations and factional divisions committed the vast swath of the inhabitants to inevitable annihilation.&#x20;
