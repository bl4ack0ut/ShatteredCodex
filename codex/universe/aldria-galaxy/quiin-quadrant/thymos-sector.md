# Thymos Sector

A contingent of of the most nefarious and violent criminals on Hassur managed to craft an escape vehicle prior to the destruction of the planet. However, due to limited resources and knowledge the craft was ill-equipped to get far and ended up stranding the collective on the planet Kouti in the Thymos sector. In an unexpected twist, a small scientific expedition returning to study Hassur's remains, detected the presence of life on Kouti and landed to investigate. The party was taken hostage instantly, their resources seized, and their ship hijacked. With the new knowledge and technology at hand a subset of the most powerful criminals struck out and found a new nearby planet on which to establish a fresh colony. Piecemeal they moved the remainder of their compatriots. Eventually they had created a terrible intermingling of intelligence and moral degradation, populating the inhabitable planets throughout the entirety of Thymos. The sector is now known for the ruthless men and women who inhabit it and is largely avoided.&#x20;
