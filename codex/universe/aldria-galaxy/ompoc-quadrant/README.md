# Ompoc Quadrant

Quadrant bordered by Sitorian and Quiin, opposite Vi. Ompoc is generally considered to be the "industrial" section of the galaxy. Home to both Omsatek and Nexus Industries Technology. The vast majority of the population of Ompoc is composed of poor, struggling, working class people. The once thriving industry of Kovolite mining that took place in the quadrant has largely disappeared and with it the wealth that accompanied it. Once example of this is Yeratak-1, the home planet of Oorla.
