# Rotaula Prime

The spire at the center of the kovolite mining, the sheer immensity and span of the mountain is beyond comprehension. Rising to a staggering 29 miles above the surface of the planet and cut through by thousands of tunnels and shafts, there is nothing in the known universe to compare with it's stature. It was the subject of countless songs, poems, and other cultural artistic creations. It has since taken on an entirely new metaphorical meaning for the inhabitants of the doomed economy; a representation of the magnitude of their sorrow and loss.&#x20;

"...Gone are the rains,

Hope swallowed in the face of Rotaula,

We pull only death from it's bosom..." -Aktalama (from -Impaling Thorn-)
