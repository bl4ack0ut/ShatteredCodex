# Yeratak-1

Approximately 50,000 lightyears from Omorphia, this planet is home to heavy kovolite mining and the fearsome Ten-Kala-Mandin. Generally run by a combination of corrupt politicians and a ruthless criminal cabal, there are a select few high ranking governmental officials who have sought to keep the societal structure from collapsing into a complete kratocracy through a multitude of slowly failing stratagems. The citizenry is largely dependent on the diminished, yet extant market for kovolite among the lower classes of the galaxy. The decreased demand has resulted in companies cutting corners to keep mining operations profitableâ€”however, the discarded vertices are most often those of personal protection for miners. The cycle is vicious and inescapable. Poverty is rampant, the poor become miners, the miners become sick from mining and leave behind more poverty. A planet once prosperous, glittering, and dotted with a thousand metropolises is now increasingly barren, crumbling, and halted.
