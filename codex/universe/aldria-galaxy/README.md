The Aldria Galaxy is approximately 138,000 lightyears in diameter. The galactic rotational period is 120,000,000 years. At the center of the structure is a supermassive blackhole around which orbits Pylon, the Guild's Refinery planet/machine. There are four quadrants: Vi, Quiin, Ompoc, and Sitorian. The primary Guild controlled locations are Pytheas, Pylon, and Anaxima.&#x20;
