# Nitthria

Several systems distant from Omorphia, but still near enough as to be readily accessible is an outlying planet, Nitthria. Cold and dark on the surface, the interior has been carved into extensively in order to take advantage of the still-warm core.

The vast cavernous hollows and vaulted corridors are a wondrous network that makes up the blackmarket Myrmekes. Everything that can be collected, discovered, or stolen is sold here. Stalls and shops populate every level, but the deeper you go, the darker and more obscure the merchandise becomes.

Periodic raids by the Imperial Guild or other galactic forces of power are not uncommon, but it is nearly always in service to some political gain or deeper scheme and rarely with the direct aim of saving souls in distress or merely removing access to contraband.
