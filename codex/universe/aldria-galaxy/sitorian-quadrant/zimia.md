# Zimia

The most beautiful dead planet known; Zimia is a sphere, barring a handful of small dots of land, entirely coated in the blue of a hypersaline sea. All land eroded, only the tips of a few mountains remaining above the water line, shores encrusted in a yellowish ring of salt. The seas and shores are lifeless and glittering. It is well known that the waters of Zimia are one of the greatest places to dispose of unwanted evidence due to the rapid accreted layers which the salts seas deposit. It is, therefore, little surprise that the sea floor is covered with a variety of unidentifiable masses.
