# Rhigma

One of a number of collection sites scattered strategically throughout the Universe. The societies built up around these locations tend to be dangerous, brutish, and fiercely hierarchical. Rhigma is no exception. Leadership is stringent, at times violent, and exceedingly suspicious of outsiders.&#x20;

They run slow, massive, and incredibly efficient barges in circulation between major population hubs and the planet in order to collect refuse. Processing is methodical. Separation and compartmentalization of all components of value is followed by the purification of precious metals and reclamation of desirable power sources and fluids. Remaining metal scrap is sent to local foundries and unrecyclable materials are repurposed into walls, floors, roofs, joists, doors, bridges and every other needful thing to expand and perfect the towns and cities on the planet. All living spaces on the surface are in fact constructed of reclaimed materials.&#x20;

The motto of the Rhigmites, Nothing wasted.&#x20;
