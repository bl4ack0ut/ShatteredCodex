# Archias

Significantly larger than Pytheas, Archias' crust is primarily composed of feldspar and experiences both large amounts of volcanic activity and, consequently, sulphur production. The atmosphere is thick, the surface warm from the trapped heat, and the gravity is measurably more intense. There is some limited mining activity and resource collection on the planet, but no permanent settlements.

The gravitational pull of the planet holds three moons, fancifully referred to as the Three Sisters.
