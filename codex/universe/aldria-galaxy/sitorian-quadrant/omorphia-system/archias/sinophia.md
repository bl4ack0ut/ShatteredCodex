# Sinophia

The most forgiving of the three sisters, Sinophia possesses a thin atmosphere and low-level core heat radiation. Owing to these and some other unlisted advantages, the Guild has installed their own outpost on this moon from which they can run emergency and military operations, some scientific researches, and off-world strategic negotiations. All public traffic to the moon is strictly prohibited.

An underground detention center for opponents and dissidents has been theorized, but no evidence exists.
