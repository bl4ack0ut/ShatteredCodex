# Pytheas

The planet Pytheas was once a relatively unknown, uninhabited, and ignored orb floating in the Sitorian sector. It ascended to prominence in concert with the rise of the Imperial Guild, previously known as the Kyroskia Space Guild, and their control of the economic powerhouse resource Eonite.&#x20;

Dominated by massive igneous rock formations and sand, the surface of Pytheas is devoid of native life. Days are 36 hours long (i.e. 1 pysol) and a trip around the orbit is approximately 250 pysols. Though water is existent, it is not found pooled, but instead collected from the atmosphere for personal use through various condensation methods. The surface is additionally plagued by periodic large wind storms and an incessant heat from the relative nearness to Omorphia.

Until recent times the surface deposits of Eonite were abundant, but have since become scarce. However, under the surface it is present in abundance, but the labor required is both intensive and hazardous. This discovery led to the Guild opening the planet for the first time in history to anyone outside of their direct hireâ€”the galactic call for Colonists to come and mine.&#x20;

All rights to Pytheas are owned and controlled by the Guild, having been purchased for a pittance some 95 cycles ago. Hushed rumors continue to circulate regarding strange objects found during expeditions and digs. Many believe the planet holds more mysteries than ever expected.
