# Apostaxos

Sole natural satellite of the planet and approximately one-quarter its size. Generally off limits to the public, the Guild keeps a contingent of scientists, Nocturne, and supplies stationed on an outpost built into the surface. Non-volcanic, rocky with iron deposits, and spherical, Apostaxos is broadly considered both stable and featureless.  &#x20;
