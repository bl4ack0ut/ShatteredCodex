# Omorphia

A main sequence dwarf K-type star. Omorphia is technically processing through the shift from being a G-type, white light emitting, solar body to being a K-type orange light emitter. The hydrogen stores at the center of the sun are expected to be largly depleted within the next 250,000 years.
