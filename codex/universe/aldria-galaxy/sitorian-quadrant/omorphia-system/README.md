# Omorphia System

A system composed of seven planets, four moons, and an asteroid belt between the fourth and fifth planets. All main celestial bodies have orbits in a roughly flat plane except for the seventh, Scylax, whose motion takes place on a tilt of roughly 33ยบ off the plane of the rest.

Though technically only possessing ownership of Pytheas, the Guild rules the entire system in practice; patrolling and acting as they see fit on any of the planets and moons in the area.
