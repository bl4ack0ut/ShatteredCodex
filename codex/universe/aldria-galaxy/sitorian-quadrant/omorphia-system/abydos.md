# Abydos

Similar in composition to Pytheas, though somewhat larger, the third planet holds an atmosphere heavy in carbon dioxide. It's orbital period is 375 pysols and an axial rotation lasts 216 hours. Because of the atmospheric composition there has been discussion in recent years by several industrial entities about the potential for terraforming the planet to create a near-Pythean locality for housing a substantial population. However, the Imperial Guild has stymied all attempts at such action, stating simply, "the vast and numerous alkali pools covering the landscape make the project too substantial an undertaking at this time and the nearness to the Guild operations make it a safety concern.&#x20;
