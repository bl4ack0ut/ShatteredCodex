# Demodamas

Small and largely seared from exposure to the heat of the star, this second largest planet of the Omorphia system has an average orbital period of 125 pysols and a rotational period of 432 hours. Molten iron and nickel core, the rocky surface exhibits some volcanic activity and when combined with the intense heat, the limited volume of traffic to the planet is completely understandable.
