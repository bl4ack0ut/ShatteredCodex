# Nearchus

Though technically within the habitable zone, Nearchus has some of the most difficult, yet promising terrain. Intrepid explorers will find polar methane ice sheets, frigid climate, and a jagged equator. Some poor merchants are known to make quick trips down for water collection, but not much else takes place with regularity.
