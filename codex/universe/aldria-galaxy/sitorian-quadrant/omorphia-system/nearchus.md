# Nearchus

Though technically within the habitable zone, Nearchus has some of the most difficult, yet promising terrain. Visitors will find polar methane ice sheets, frigid climate, and a jagged equator. Some poor merchants are known to make quick trips down for water collection, but the only regulars on the surface are the patrons and employees of Paradise Bar.
