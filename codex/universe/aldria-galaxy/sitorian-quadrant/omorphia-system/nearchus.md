# Nearchus

Though technically within the habitable zone, Nearchus has some of the most difficult, yet promising terrain. Visitors will find polar methane ice sheets, frigid climate, and a jagged equator. Some poor merchants are known to make quick trips down for water collection in various outland areas, but the only regulars on the surface are the patrons and employees of Paradise Bar situated as the near the equator and the most stable region as possible.
