# Vyzallid Belt

Resting between the orbits of Archias and Nearchus, the Vyzallid Belt's asteroids are primarily composed of iron, ice, and stone. Navigation within the Belt is notoriously dangerous and the interference makes tracking difficult. It should come as no surprise that this is where the Ai-Lax pirates have taken up their residence following the SkyCutter Peace Treaty signing. These O'ru Ai-Lax now occupy hollowed out, impregnable fortresses in some of the larger rocks, vastly increasing the dangers of the Belt.&#x20;
